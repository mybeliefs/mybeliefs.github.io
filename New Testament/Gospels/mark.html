He becomes famously quick because of his healings/miracles and speaking. Image a person healing the sick! But he did not follow the rules set up by the Pharisees. He even feeds 5000 and walks on water.</li><li>What comes out of my heart is what defiles me: bad thoughts, greed, deceit, etc. Don’t let traditions get in the way of having a pure heart. </li><li>To save your life you must deny yourself? What does this mean? We need to pursue God and his purposes, not our own (natural tendencies of me first). </li><li>We need to just believe .. 9:24 “I believe; help me overcome my unbelief”. Trusting in God often still includes doubt. Later we are told to receive the “kingdom of God” like a little child 10:15. So trust and belief can be simple .. not overly complicated. Ask, believe, and you will receive it - 11:24. Can this be? </li><li>Everyone left him when he was arrested; Peter denied Jesus three times.
