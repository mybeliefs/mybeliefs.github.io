But the Spirits us free from the law, death. We are to live by the Spirit because the law did not change us, but rather just revealed our sins. It was powerless. But we do not live according to our sinful nature but by the Spirit <code>v4</code>.  Also, we are controlled by the Spirit of God who lives in us <code>v9</code>.  We have no obligation to live to our sinful nature <code>v12</code>. If we live according to it you will die <code>v13</code>. <strong>But living by the Spirit you put to death the misdeed of your sinful nature <code>v13</code></strong>. So what does this look like in our life? We can always pray for forgiveness, but we are newly empowered to live differently .. not sinning as much? Where living by the law did not change our behavior. I know that we are made righteous because of God’s “sin offering”, but what about our behaviour? Should it be dramatically different? Sometimes I don’t feel that different. <ul><li><em>{PRAY - Lord help me understand how You make it right for me. You justify me. You make all things work for my good - to shape me to be more like you. You have made a plan for me. You have already taken care of the future for me. Help me to understand and realize this. That I would NOT be afraid in life. That I would have joy now. And because of this I would be changed on the inside, motivated and enabled to live according to your purposes.}</em></li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="observations">Observations<a class="hash-link" href="#observations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Romans is about the gospel -- good news on what has been done!</li><li>Obedience comes through faith (v1:5) -- a result of faith, not a condition </li><li>Paul is commissioned to bring the gospel to Gentiles.
