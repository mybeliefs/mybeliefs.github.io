That promise is the only ground for our confidence in asking. Such confidence is not &quot;worked up&quot; from within our emotional life; rather, it is given and supported by what God has said in Scripture.”</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>“This is why true prayer can never be divorced from real holiness. The prayer of faith can be made only by the &quot;righteous&quot; man whose life is being more and more aligned with the covenant grace and purposes of God.”</em></p></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="not-sure">Not Sure<a class="hash-link" href="#not-sure" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There are many areas of my faith that I am now sure about.</p><ul><li>For people who don’t hear the gospel, what happens to them? Only God knows, and we trust in His perfect righteousness that goes beyond our comprehension.

Even the <em>big bang</em> theory points to a specific starting point. How could <strong>nothing</strong> create the Commos? The complexity that we have in our galaxy to the intricacies contained in our eyes is overwhelming. For me, it is easier to believe in the <em>virgin birth of Christ</em>, whereas an atheist believes in the <em>virgin birth of the universe</em>.</p><ul><li>The <strong>world exists</strong>, which in itself is proof</li><li>The <strong>Fine-Tunning</strong> argument.

Our response to <em>beauty</em>, <em>art</em>, and <em>love</em> tells us intuitively there is a purpose to this world. These are not just accidental occurrences.</li><li>We all have natural <strong>desires for eternity, justice, love, etc.</strong>, don&#x27;t these <em>point to something greater</em> than a random materialistic world?</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="experience">Experience<a class="hash-link" href="#experience" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="personal">Personal<a class="hash-link" href="#personal" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>My personal experience. As a young teenager, I had a need. <strong>I worried excessively. I had no peace</strong>. So I was searching for something, something to take away the worry. This search opened me up to go to church with our housekeeper’s son. I had been brought up going to a Luthern church, but it had no impact on me. Something my mother made me do. I still remember being in a group of other kids and they were singing. It was different. Not long after attending this church, I decided to commit myself and live for Christ. I am not sure if I knew what that meant, but I decided to trust God. It was at a Saturday night church service and I was 15. <strong>Everything changed after that evening</strong>, and I have never looked back. The peace I was looking for, came immediately.</p><p>So I was motivated by a <strong>need</strong>, I was searching.</p><p>That initial experience sometimes is called being <em>born again</em>, which happened over 40 years ago. But my <u>current</u> experiences influence why I believe today. Meaning I still have a need - purpose, forgiveness, meaning beyond my current circumstances, and perspective on the ups and downs of life.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nature">Nature<a class="hash-link" href="#nature" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>I believe that nature points to God. When experiencing the beauty of nature and all of its creation I am simply in awe. What about animals, the ocean, mountains, lakes, forests, and deserts? How about the birth of a child? The complexity of the body. There are so many unbelievable wonders in this world that <strong>all point to a creator</strong> when giving serious thought to the issue.</p><p>A scripture reference:</p><ul><li>Romans 1:20 - For since the creation of the world <code>God’s invisible qualities</code> — his eternal power and divine nature — <code>have been seen</code>, being understood from what has been made, so that people are <strong>without excuse</strong>.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="morality">Morality<a class="hash-link" href="#morality" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Everyone and every culture understand morality - a standard by which people should live by independent of their convictions.</p><ul><li>Everyone has moral feelings, what is right and what is wrong.</li><li>Where do human rights come from?</li></ul><p>Without a belief in a higher power, there is no real justification for them.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="brokeness">Brokeness<a class="hash-link" href="#brokeness" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>There is a sense that the world does not work as intended - it is broken.</p><ul><li>Wars</li><li>Sickness</li><li>Disabilities</li><li>Mental health issues</li><li>Fractured relationships</li><li>Guilt</li><li>Addictions</li><li>Death</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>We all long for more. How do we make sense of this? Where is our identity? Through relationships, accomplishments, pleasure?</p><p>We are continually disappointed.

The battles of the book of Joshua, for example, were a part of God’s plan to cleanse the land of evil practices that had enslaved the people of Canaan. The Bible is telling us about God’s mission to restore his rebellious creation and bring all of humanity back to himself. This story continues with the New Testament of Christ&#x27;s triumphed over death, through the violence of the cross.<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup></li><li>Total dismantling of the Canaanite civilzation was necessary to protect Israel against becoming corrupted. This is a critical time in history, judgement is on the land, and God&#x27;s plans to save the whole world are being enacted.<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup></li><li>God is gracious and merciful, He is also a God of holiness and wrath. <sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup></li><li>The God of the new testament shows similar characteristics. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5%3A4-10&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 5:4-10</a>, the couple suddenly dies when withholding their proceeds from selling property. The book of Revelations has lots of destruction in it. <em>The God of the Old and New Testament should be feared, while at the same time is all-loving.</em></li><li>God had morally sufficient reasons for His judgement on Canaan, and Israel was merely the instrument of His justice.
