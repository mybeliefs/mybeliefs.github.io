- [First-century Judaism](./New%20Testament/overview#first-century-beliefs-judaism) groups.
- Many of the converts were Hellenist Jews (from other areas of the Roman Empire). [^2]
- Christians were barred from synagogue services [^3]
- AD 70 with the destruction of the temple marked the end of the apostolic age

## Catholic Christianity: 70-312
- Catholic meaning *universal*

  - A real conviction
  - Meet a need vs the Stoicism philophsy
  - The practice of real love - caring forthe poor, widows, orphans

### Persecution
In the early days, the Christian lifestyle was an indirect condemnation of the pagan way of life. This resulted in hatred of Christians, who also rejected the gods of the Greeks and Romans (many of them). In 64 there was a fire that Nero blamed on the Christians which resulted in many Christians being crucified. Some believe Paul and Peter were martyred during this time.

Roman's policy was to be accommodating to a conquered country's religion, as long as there was homage to the emperor. Once the Jews made it known that Christians were not a part of there group things changed around 200 AD. Christians were different:
- Jews were kept to themselves and never actively proselytized
- But Christians were from all of the population
- And we're always trying to convince others not to worship the emperor

:::info
The supreme cause of Roman persecution of Christians arose from the tradion of emperor worship. [^7]
:::

### Orthodoxy
In the **2nd century**, Gnosticism attempted to reshape the gospel. The responses to Gnosticism were `clergy`, `creed`, and the `canon`.

:::important
The basic belief of the Gnostics was what we call `dualism`, that the world is divided between two cosmic forces, good and evil. There were `spiritual` things that were regarded as **pure**, and material things regarded as **bad**.

The responses to Gnosticism were **clergy**, **creed**, and the **[canon](./Apologetics/bible-study-research#the-cannon)**.
 [^8]
:::

#### Terms
There are three main branches of Christianity: *Roman Catholic*, *Eastern Orthodox*, and *Protestant*.

- `Theology` - Our rational thoughts, beliefs, and understanding of God.
- `Religion` - Our belief in God and our effort to live by those beliefs.
- `Orthodoxy` - Good theology; right beliefs that are upheld by the church.
- `Heresy` - Beliefs held outside of Orthodoxy.

### Bishops
By the 2nd century, the unchallenged leaders in church affairs were the bishops. This was strengthened by the conflict with the Gnostics. Catholic Christians countered (Gnostics) by stressing the public teaching of the churches, the rule of faith, and the **bishops** in the churches established by the apostles. [^9]

Originally the church did not forgive extreme sins - sexual immorality, murder, and denial of the faith (apostasy). Only God could forgive these types of sins. However, through extreme persecution by the Emperor of Rome in mid 3rd century, many believers were forced to deny their faith. Overtime penance was introduced to allow members to re-enter into the church (i.e. Lord's Supper). During this time the authority of the bishop of Rome was positioned to *flow from Peter*, thus claiming special authority. [^10]


### Church Fathers
A list of early [church fathers](https://chat.openai.com/share/f982afba-7a28-40b6-ac9e-4ab36c2ab45d) arranged by approximate date:

2. Ignatius of Antioch (1st century)
3. Polycarp (1st - 2nd century)
4. Justin Martyr (2nd century)
5. Irenaeus (2nd century)
6. Tertullian (2nd - 3rd century)
7. Origen (2nd - 3rd century) - the great theologian
8. Athanasius (4th century)
9. Augustine of Hippo (4th - 5th century)
10. Jerome (4th - 5th century)

#### Intellectuals
**Hellenism**, the influence of Greek culture and language, was integrated into the defense of Christianity by *Clement* and *Origen*. *Clement* had knowledge of Greek philosophy and classical literature.  He wanted to be an apostle to the Hellenistic intellectual world. *Origen* took over *Clement's* school at the age of 18. Note that  *Tertullian* was opposed to reconciling with Hellenic philosophy. [^11]
