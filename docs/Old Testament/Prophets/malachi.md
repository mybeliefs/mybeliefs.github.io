- [Introduction to Malachi](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-malachi)

## Overview

- ~ 80 years after Haggai and Zechariah encouraged the rebuilding of the temple
- Had not experienced the renewal/prosperity stated by the other prophets for rebuilding the temple
- Faced economic difficulties due to drought and crop failure
- Lost of hope, worship was a mere form, no substance 

### Bible Project
TBD

### Purpose

- Rebuke the people for departing from the worship of the law of God, call the people back to Jehovah, and revive their national spirit.
- Coming to judge, bless, and restore 

### Outline (4 chapters)

1. Polluted Offerings
2. Rebuked Priests
3. Return to Me
4. Great Day of the Lord

### Difficulties

- Prophecy in general, antique writings 

## Observations

- Like the Jews, we expect God’s blessings to happen immediately. Thus, we can get discouraged and lose our faith and commitment. 
- We need to always remember God’s faithfulness.
