- [Introduction to 1st and 2nd Kings](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-1-2-kings/)


## Overview

- Division of the kingdom after **Solomon**: **Jeroboam** (official, Israel, northern tribes) and **Rehoboam**(Judah, southern, son of Solomon)
- Both sides had `20` kings; 
  - `Israel` had 9 dynasties 
  - `Judah` had only 1 line: *the house of David*
- **Israel**:
  - All evil kings
  - Israel's last king was Hoshea. They were taken into captivity by the Assyrians. They left some Israelites and transplanted others captives from foreign lands for intermarriage. Thus, they became the Samaritans (who the Jews ended up hating).
- **Judah**: 
  - Note that Judah lasts for an additional 150 years beyond Israel. 
  - **Good kings (6)**
    - Joash (became king at 7)
    - Amaziah
    - Azariah
    - Jotham
    - **Hezekiah** is the godliest. Does lots of reform. But shows off his fortunes to the Babylonians. Holds off the Assyrians who only a few years before had taken Israel into captivity. 
    - **Josiah** the great-grandson of Hezekiah. Godly reign. Found the Law of Moses. Public reading, vow to follow God. Celebrated Passover. The last of the Godly kings. 
  - **Manasseh** was very evil. Son of Hezekiah. Idolatry played a big role. Reigned the longest, 55 years. Often persecuted prophets.
  - **Josiah sons**:
- 3rd son Jehoahaz becomes king - 3 months reign. Removed by Pharaoh-Neco
- 2nd son Jehoiakim was then placed on the throne. 11-year reign. Taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar, along with Daniel. But stayed on the throne. Then stopped supporting Babylon. Was harassed in his country by Syrians, etc. 
- His son Jehoiachin, becomes king until Nebuchadnezzar takes Jerusalem. 
- Now the 1st son Mattaniah is put on the throne and named changed to Zedekiah. Is a puppet for Nebuchadnezzar.
- Zedekiah forms an alliance with Egypt which causes Babylon to invade Judah. The temple is burned.  
- **Prophets**:
  - Elijah was taken up to heaven
    - Elisha miracles
    - Fills a poor lady’s vessel
    - Raise a lady’s dead son
    - Heals leprosy 
    - Ax-handle swim in the water

### Difficulties

- Chap 2. - The taking up of Elijah. 
- Elisha curses the boys, then they are killed by a bear. The whole story is weird. Note that Panorama Bible commentary provides a nice overview. 
- The random miracles of Elisha in chapter 4. Seem like stories almost made up to make Elisha famous. 
- In chapter 13 a random story of a dead body touched Elisha’s bones and came back to life.


## Observations

- Uses the term “did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat”
- Term **high places** often (117 times in OT). Many times states “He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord,...The high places, however, were not removed; ...” 2 Kings 15:3-4. 
  - The high places were altars on elevated hills near towns. 
  - They were warned to “demolish all of their high places .. “ before crossing the Jordan into Canaan (Num. 33:52,55). There they worshiped the Canaanite deities (~ 26 gods). 
  - Even king Solomon built a high place because of his Canaanite wives. Hezekiah, 215 years after Solomon, finally puts an end to the “high places”.
