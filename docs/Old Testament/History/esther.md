## Observations

- There are lots of injustices in this world. Often we can ask “where is God”. The book of Esther shows that God often is working behind the scene.  
- How do we make sense of things? The story is not finished yet.
- Christ shows up and takes on all of the injustices in this world. 
- God will eventually make all things new. 
- The Christian faith is not hopeful thinking. Does not promise every chapter in our life gets better. No there are ups and downs for everyone. It does promise that one day all things will be made new. 

## Chapters (10)
