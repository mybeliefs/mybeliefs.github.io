#### Highlights

- Solomon’s brother 1st time to become king, then makes a request for a wife who served David. This is a threat, he is executed. 
- God tells Solomon to “ask for whatever you want” -- A discerning heart
- Has great success; builds the temple (7 years); builds his palace (13 years)
- The LORD appears to him a 2nd time .. follow my decrees or face disaster
- Solomon has many wives; begins following their gods (11:4 .. not fully devoted to the LORD his GOD)
- Israel and Judah split. Solomon's son Rehoboam does not listen to advice and is harsh on the people. Leads to a rebellion. 
- Jeroboam (king of Israel) is afraid people who worship will lead them back to Rehoboam. Sets up idols to replace God.
- Warfare between Israel and Judah 
- Elijah the prophet tells king Ahab (Israel) no rain; God takes care of Elijah (stays with a widow)
- Elijah performs miracles; has false prophets executed; rain is coming
- Ahab wins a war. Takes a vineyard. Is told by Elijah “disaster..”. But he humbles himself and is spared. 

### Difficulties

- How does God communicate with the Prophets?

## Observations

- Solomon starts out seeking God. Tells the people `8:58` *“may he turn our hearts to him, to walk in obedience and keep the commands...”*. Is blessed by God, but eventually falls away from God. 11:4 “not fully devoted” like his father David
- Next, it seems all of the kings are bad. They all do evil. Israel is one bad king after another. Fully family lines are destroyed in Israel. 
- Judah keeps the line clean, and 2 of the kings “do good”. Asa, the grandson of Solomon, is a good king -- fully committed to the LORD. His son becomes king and is also a good king.
