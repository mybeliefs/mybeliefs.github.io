### Difficulties

- Angle fighting in a war (32 - “..an angel is sent to cut down all of the Assyrian men”)

## Observations

- Solomon’s asked for wisdom, not great wealth or power. Seeks the right thing and is greatly blessed for it. Places his energy and focus on building a temple for God. Leads the people in worship ... a great pray. Is told that if the people humbled themselves and seek God, He will forgive their sins and heal their land. 
- Although their father as King sought the Lord, sons often go their own evil way. The 1st example is Rehoboam ch. 12 “abandoned the law of the Lord”. But then some of the kings “do what is good in the sight of the Lord”. 
- Special kings: 
  - Jehoshaphat - devoted, removed idols, encouraged the people to follow the Lord
  - Joash - the boy king. Restored temple, took offerings 
  - Uzziah - did right, but was proud
  - Jotham - powerful because he walked with the Lord
  - Hezekiah - Repaired the temple, started sacrifices again 
  - Josiah - Restored temple, revival, celebrated Passover
