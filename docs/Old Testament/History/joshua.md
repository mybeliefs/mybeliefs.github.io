- [Introduction to Joshua](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-joshua/)

## Overview

- Joshua might have written most of the content
- Finally allowed to enter the promised land ... after being slaves in Egypt (400+ years) and wandering in the desert (40 years).
- Moses changed his name to Joshua .. meaning “The LORD Saves”. In greek means Jesus. Thus, Jesus came to give his people a final “resting” place.
- Was one of the 12 spies, along with Caleb, to say lets “go”


### Bible Project
TBD

### Purpose
History of entering the promised land

### Outline (24)

- 1-4     Entering the promised land 
- 5-12   Conquering the promised land (starting with Jericho)
- 13-21 Distribution of the promised land 
- 22-24 Tribal Unity and Remembering 

### Difficulties

- `Ch 7` - Archan steals, he and his whole family is killed 
The general killing of the Canaanites {they were a people who practices terrible things. Not all innocent were killed.} 
- `Ch 10` “.. stopping the sun” {1st believing in the almighty God who can do anything, control physical properties of the world he created it, should not cause doubt. There are some different ways to interpret the text and make it more possible}

## Observations

- Told not to forget the Book of the Law
- This time the spies bring back a good report ... “they are afraid of us”
- Like the Red sea parting the Jordan dries up for them to cross
- On entering they (i) are circumcised (ii) celebrate Passover (iii) march around Jericho. They are given a great victory
- But next time sin is found in their camp and are defeated. They are required to remove the person and family.
- The land is divided up among the tribes
- They have the intent to follow the LORD. Even a misunderstanding about an Altar almost caused a war between tribes.
