- [Introduction to 1st and 2nd Samuel](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-1-2-samuel/)


## Overview

- Captures the history of establishing the monarchy in Israel; history view
- Saul was similar to Moses ... covenant continuity from Judges to Kings
- Samuel anointed both Saul and David
- Originally 1 book in the Hebrew Bible (original collection of Jewish texts)
- Author unknown; written after Solomon (David’s son)
- Used other resources (“Book of Jasher”) to compose this book

### Bible Project
TBD

### Purpose

- Historical: the origin of the Davidic dynasty & role of the prophets from judges to kings 
- Christological: introduces “anointed”

### Outline (31 chapters)

- `1-7` Career of Samuel
- `8-15` Rise of King Saul
- `16-31` Decline of Saul, the rise of David

### Difficulties

- The pulling around the Ark, had great power 6:7. 6:17 When “they looked into the Ark of the LORD they were struck down”. Hard to understand how the Ark was used by God, seems weird. Need to understand more about the Ark and its purposes. 
- Chap 19 Saul’s men & Saul prophesied. Why? What is the point of the story. What is the concept of the Old Testament prophets when they prophesize?  
- Chap 28 Saul speaks to Samuel who is dead through a spiritualist *{One point of view is that God intervened and performed a miracle in the house of the witch and actually brought Samuel back from the dead in order to rebuke Saul for his sin and to prophesy him doom. There are other examples of God speaking through unusual means (Balaam's donkey).}*


## Observations

- The main prophet Eli's own sons do NOT serve the Lord. Samuel becomes the main prophet. Born from a barren woman. Another example of children of believers abandoning their parent's faith. Eli’s sons are ultimately judged and killed. 
- God uses the ungodly to bring judgment on his people
- Both Eli and Samuel's children did not follow the Lord like their fathers; were corrupt
- The people wanted to be like other territories ... a king to protect and lead them. They told Samuel they wanted a king, he was getting old and his sons were not good. This was a rejection of trusting God and wanting to control things ... be like others
- Saul is chosen ... anointed ... is changed ... prophesied. But at some point, he changes. Maybe the power of being the king over time changed him to reject serving the Lord.
- Instead of waiting on Samuel to seek the Lord, Saul offers the burnt and peace offering. I am assuming he is taking things into his own hands. Wants to ensure they will be Ok, but breaks the established process. Huge mistake ... is told his kingdom will not endure
- Another mistake by Saul is when he did not completely destroy the Amalekites. Again took things into his own hands.  **“...To obey is better than sacrifice, ...”** `15:22`  
- Samuel told to move on from Saul. Samuel was still scared that Saul would kill him if he found out that anointed someone else.
- David is chosen, the youngest of Jesse’s sons. The spirit is on David. He trusts Him and defeats Goliath 
- David is blessed in everything, which makes Saul even more jealous. Saul gives him his daughter, but then continues trying to kill David. 
- David is by no means perfect. He deceives a King, acting like he is insane.
- On two occasions David could have killed Saul but believes Saul is the Lord’s anointed servant and will not harm him. 
- Saul eventually is badly wounded in a battle and decides to fall on his sword to avoid being tortured.
