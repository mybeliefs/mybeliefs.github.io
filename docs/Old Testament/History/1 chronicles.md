- Priestly point of view; focused on Judah (southern tribe)
- David’s desire and preparation made it possible for Solomon to build the temple
- Covers roughly the same period as Samuel 1 and 2
- Written after the Babylonian captivity. Note the northern tribe went to Assyrian captivity, never to return

### Difficulties

- Why are “lots” used to determine God’s will (i.e. `24:5`)
- David takes on more wives (Ch 14.)

## Observations

- David put great importance into praising God. Chapter 16 details how the Ark proclaims God’s great name, remembers his acts, declares his glory, etc.
- In Chapter 17 David shows his humility in front of God “Who am I, Lord God, ... that you have brought me this far?”
- Why does David count the men? Is it his pride? He is punished severely for this sin. Over 3 days 70,000 men are killed. 
- David although does not build the temple, does everything to prepare for its construction.
