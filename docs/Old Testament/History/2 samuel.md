- [Introduction to 1st and 2nd Samuel](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-1-2-samuel/)


## Overview

- Author unknown; written after Solomon (David’s son)
- Covers the empire’s expansion under David
- David was king of Judah for `7 ½ years`, king of all of Israel for `33 years`


### Bible Project
TBD

### Purpose

- Historical: the origin of the Davidic dynasty & role of the prophets from judges to kings 
- Christological: introduces “anointed”

### Outline (24 chapters)

- `1-10` David on the throne
- `11-18` Rejection of David on the throne
- `19-24` Restoration of David to the throne 

#### Highlights

- Although persecuted by Saul still mourns his death
- Only becomes the king of Judah at first (7 years). Saul’s commander Abner makes one of Saul’s sons the king
- Judah and Israel fight each other
- Eventually, Abner switches to David’s side but is killed by one of David’s men
- At 30 becomes the king of Israel (note - fled King Saul for ~ 8 years)
- Reclaims the Ark, one person struck dead by God because he touched the Ark
- David sings and dances bringing the Ark back to the city; one of his wives mocks him
- Wants to build a house for the Ark, but told his son will build the house
- David prays “Who am I ... that you brought me this far?”
- Takes care of Jonathan’s lame son
- Sins badly with Bathsheba, their 1st child dies at birth
- Repents!
- David's son rapes his half-sister, 2 years later another son (Absalom) kills the brother in revenge
- Absalom is forced to leave, but returns later and then conspires against David. 
- David has to flee
- They battle and Absalom is killed (although David's instructions were to be gentle). 
- David mourns the loss of his son; told to stop mourning otherwise his men will not follow him
- The Gibeonites get revenge for a past failing of Saul (broken covenant) 
- David counts his fighting men, a plague occurs, and David repents!


### Difficulties

- How did David communicate with the LORD (2:1 David inquired of the Lord. “Shall I ...”)
- Chapter 21 David asked God why He had withheld rain for 3 years. Was told a covenant was broken by Saul with the Gibeonites. Restitution (revenge) occurs by taking descendants of Saul (7 sons and grandsons) and killing them. This was because Saul have tried to wipe these people (Gibeonites) out. The Lord would not answer prayers until things were put right with the Gibeonites. The Gibeonites asked for this type of restitution. 
  - **CONCERN**: To me, the revenge seems brutal. The sons were not a part of Saul’s decisions. The killing of people just seems to be so common. 
  - **RESPONSE**: This was a case of national restitution. The Gibeonites had been wronged. During this time and culture, this was the act requested .. in effect a casualty of war. The act of restitution was right, although the payment was not fair to Saul’s descendants. God did not hold the children responsible for their parent's sins, the Gibeonites did. The leaders of Israel had sworn to the Gibeonites by the Lord that they would not kill any of them. Israel (Saul) had broken this covenant, hurting the name of Jehovah. Reference article

## Observations

- David’s life is very messy. Put into great responsibility .. the king. So many events always going on (i.e. war). 
- He made so many mistakes. But he always repented. He always praised God. This is the common theme for David.  
- His children become huge issues for him. One son rapes a half-sister. The other brother takes revenge and kills the other brother. This same son tries to take the kingdom from his father. But through it, all David deeply loved his son. 
- David truly loved God despite all of his flaws. Sings praises (Psalm 18)
    - I love you, LORD, my strength
    - The Lord is my rock, my fortress,...
    - I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise
