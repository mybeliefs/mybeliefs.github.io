- Nehemiah’s first response when hears about the hardship -- wept, fast, pray 
  - Reminds God of his covenant 
- Always faced opposition. Life is never easy, even when you are in God’s will. 
- Did not stand for injustice (chap 5). Took action to fix things, and made demands on others. 
- Chapter 9 - One of the great prays of the bible
  - Recalls God’s work in the Jewish nation 
  - Praise God for his mercy, faithful, etc., despite the people’s rebellion
  - States when the people are at **rest**, again they do evil
- Nehemiah character:
  - Sought out firsthand the details of the situation
  - Engaged in labor himself; left a comfortable position working for the king
  - Undeterred by the opposition
  - Cared deeply for the people to follow God correctly
- Always seem to fall into rebellion over and over again. Why? 
- `Pray`: *Lord through your providence keeps me from abandoning you. Guide me to your rest and not to idols. Keep me safe from me. I can’t do life without living for you.*
