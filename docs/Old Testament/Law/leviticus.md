### Bible Project
TBD

### Purpose
TBD

### Outline (27 chapters)

- The way to the Holy One `1-10`
    - God is approached by sacrifice and the priesthood
    - 5 different types of offerings
        - Burnt
        - Grain (Cereal)
        - Peace (Fellowship)
        - Sin
        - Guilt
    - Sacrifice had to be administered by a Priest (or mediator)
- The way of holiness `11-27`
    - Sanitation (purity of body): `11-16`
    - Sanctification (purity of soul): `17-27`


### Difficulties

- `19:19` - “Don’t wear clothes woven of two kinds of material”
- `19:27` - “Don’t cut the hair on the sides of your head or trim your beard.
- Some of the statements about disobedience (26:14+) .. multiply your afflictions 7 times over, eat the flesh of your sons (26:9) ..., etc. Also the blessings ... remove savage beasts from the land (26:6). This all seems weird, hard to understand.


## Observations

- Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness
- The theme is the Nation being set apart for the service and glory of God
- The reason for the diet laws was to remind the Israelites that they were chosen as God’s holy people. So it has benefits for health (pigs carried diseases) and symbolized being separated (from the Gentiles). 
- Chapter 20 lists severe penalties for giving children to Moloch, consulting witches, cursing parents, Adultery, Incest, and Unnatural lusts (same sex). 
- There are lots of regulations guiding the people. 
- God wanted his people to be pure, follow his decrees and he would bless them and “walk among them” (v26:12). The punishments for sins are extreme. They are to be different from Egypt and the new land that God will be giving them.
