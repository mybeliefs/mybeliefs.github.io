## Overview

- Deuteronomy means 2nd law 
- Focuses on Moses re-stating the law to the next generation

### Bible Project
TBD

### Purpose
TBD

### Outline (34 chapters)

- Summary and Review
- 10 Commandments, Remember, Pay attention
- Moses - Love, Obey
- Only worship God, tithes, debt, slaves, poor
- Laws, processes, prophets, battles
- Various laws and guidelines
- Blessings & Curses
- Israel’s rebellion predicted 

### Difficulties

- Destroyed men, women, and children (v2:34, v3:6)
- Stoning a rebellious son (21.20) -- “purge evil among you”
- Stoning a woman for not being a virgin while living at home (22:21) -- “purge evil among you”
- The various laws (chap 21-25, etc.) are hard to understand. For example, relieving yourself outside the camp, for God strolls through the camp (23:12-14). Other examples of leaving uncollected grapes, etc, when harvesting for the poor. How do these guidelines affect us today?

## Observations

- God wants us to obey his instructions. Wants to bless us. Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always so that it might go well with them and their children forever! 5:29
- Do not create idols to replace our worship of the only true God
- Lots of recalling the past.
- Wanted them to be pure (pure evil among them).  Thus very strict rules (i.e. stoning). Wanted no corruption to occur because of intermingling with the Canaanites
- Lots of rituals, laws, guidelines, etc.   
- There will be severe consequences for NOT following God’s commands
- It was already known by God that Israel would rebel. 
- Why do we not trust God? Why do we always wander away? Our nature seems to at times point us away from God and only to our immediate needs/desires. Forgive us, LORD.
