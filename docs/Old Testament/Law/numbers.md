- [Introduction to Numbers](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-numbers/)

## Overview

- Historical focused (Leviticus stresses purity)
- Account of the 38-year period of Israel’s wandering in the desert
- 1st generation who were afraid
- 2nd generation that will enter the promised land
- How they did not respond with faith but rather with repeated acts of rebellion
- Had received the law and built the tabernacle. Now getting ready for a march to the promised land ... until they lose their faith


### Bible Project
TBD

### Purpose
TBD

### Outline (36 chapters)

- Direction from the Lord (1-10)
- Israel’s disbelief in the Lord (11-14)
    - Discontent with provisions (11-12)
    - The disbelief of God’s promise (13-14)
- Discipline from the LORD (15-36)
    - Passing of the Old Generation (15-26)
    - Preparation of the New Generation (27-36)

### Difficulties

- Chapter 5 “Test for an Unfaithful Wife”. Seems weird to have her drink bitter water to determine if she was unfaithful. Or if the Husband feels jealousy come over him.
- In Chapter 15 a man collected wood on the Sabbath; God said he must die. This seems very harsh and is hard to comprehend in our culture. Plus we Christian don’t really observe the Sabbath .. a day of rest (separate issue). 
- The rebellion in Chapter 16 where Korah and the group of 250 are swallowed up and then a plague kills another 17k seems brutal. When we speak of Christ we always talk about his love, forgiveness, etc. Here we have an example of God killing his people for defiant acts. Sometimes the character of God in the OT seems different than the character of Christ in the NT. Also, the miracles sometimes seem weird.
- The story of the donkey and God speaking with Balaam seems weird. How & why does God speak with Balaam? Thought only Moses could approach God. Later on, Balaam is killed when Israel attacks the Midianites (they seduced the Israelites to engage in sexual immorality and to worship the Baal of Peor).
- Killing of the Midianites, all but virgins. Again difficult to understand.

## Observations

- The people are given strict instructions, on how to be organized, rituals, etc. But they always seem to go astray. Complaining all of the time. Indulging in sexual immorality.
