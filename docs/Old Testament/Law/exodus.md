   - manna and quails
- Duty of the people (19-40)

### Difficulties

- `4:24-26` - God is about to kill Moses 
- `7:11-12`; `7:22` - Pharaoh's magicians also turned their staff into a snake and made the water turn to blood. `8:7` - also frogs. How did they do this? 


## Observations
- God spoke to Moses a lot
- The people saw great miracles ... parting of the sea, mana, etc., but they still worshipped a golden calf. Why? Even Aaron helped in creating the idol
- God provides the 10 commandments
- The Tabernacle was built ... this is where God dwelled among his people 
- The Sabbath was a very important command ... death to those who broke it
