### Purpose
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And God saw that it was **very good**. (`Genesis 1:31`). Humans were created in God's image, and they were given dominion over the earth. But they soon rebelled against God, and things quickly went from bad to worse. Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, and they were banished from the Garden of Eden. Cain murdered his brother Abel, and the world was filled with violence and chaos.

God was merciful, however, and he sent a flood to cleanse the earth. Only Noah and his family were spared. But even after the flood, humans continued to rebel against God. They built the Tower of Babel, a monument to their own pride. In response, God confused their languages and scattered them across the earth.

But even in the midst of this rebellion, God never gave up on his people. He chose a man named Abraham, and through Abraham's family, all of the nations would be blessed. God's plan of redemption was unfolding, and it would ultimately culminate in the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Through Jesus, all of humanity could be saved from sin and death.

### Difficulties 1-11

- Cain was afraid of others ... v4:14 “... whoever finds me will kill me”
   - https://www.gotquestions.org/Cain-afraid.html
     - Adam and Eve most likely had other children
     - We don't know old they are when Cain kills Abel
- Pre-flood they lived 900+ years? Then back to 120 years (6:3)
  - https://www.gotquestions.org/how-old-was-Adam-when-he-died.html
     - After the flood normal life span decreased drastically
     - The affects of sins contributed to shortening the human life span
  - https://biologos.org/articles/long-life-spans-in-genesis-literal-or-symbolic
     - Sometimes numbers were used to convey sacred meanings rather than just its numerical value
- Noah’s Ark and the Flood ... the entire world?
   - https://bibleproject.com/articles/why-did-god-flood-the-world/
     - Starting over, Noah is the new Adam
     - But evil continues
 - - https://gavinortlund.com/2015/01/03/why-a-local-flood/
      - Language points to a local flood - *"all the earth"* can mean the *"land"*
      - Ancient Near East writer refers to their area as basically everything
      - Many difficulties (miracle and miracle) to have it make sense
      - If "in the land" still requires God's intervention, but fits with the size of the ark and the number of people (8)

### Difficulties 12-50
- Why would Lot offer his daughters (19:8)?
- Does Jacob really wrestle with God all night (32:24)
- 38:7 & 38:10 State “was wicked” and God put them to death

## Observations
God is the creator. How the cosmos was created (scientific/physical) is not important. God created and it was good.

:::info
How God created the cosmos is not important.
:::

But man rebelled and evil was widespread.  God started again with the flood. Evil still continued.

God then chooses a person and his family to redeem. This family shows both faith and failure, including evil.
