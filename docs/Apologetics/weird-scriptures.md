title: Weird Scriptures

This section captures weird-sounding scriptures and provides some context.

:::info
Some verses in isolation can be challenging to make sense of, especially in our Western culture. But context and background research are often required to fully understand the meaning of the text.

## Women
 Remember in the beginning God created both men and women in His image -  [Genesis 1:27-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27-28&version=NIV). There was no hierarchy, they are living together in perfect harmony as image-bearers. But everything changes when they **disobey - in chapter 3 sin enters**. Now the relationship between men and women changes and sins affect everything (i.e. polygamy).

But even as sin dominates the culture the view of women in both the Old and New Testaments is one of great value and worth.

There are some verses that at first glance, and out of context, can be misunderstood.

### Silence
The following verses written by Paul seem to indicate that women should not speak in church:

- `1 Corinthians 14:34-35 (NIV)` *"Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. ... for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church."*
- `1 Timothy 2:11-12 (ESV)` *“A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. . . . She must be quiet.”*

The context here is Paul is addressing how a church service should be conducted. The church of Corinth was known for disorderly services.[^1] Paul's command could also be referring to specific cultural practices that we are not aware of. There are several options scholars suggest such as *not speaking if uneducated* (normal for women back then). [^2]

An important point is that women are elevated in Paul's writing, expecially compared to the current culture. The environment written about was two thousand years ago, and we will never know all the specifics of what might have been going on in the church services.

### Head Covering
The following verse seems to indicate that women should were a head covering in church:

- [1 Corinthians 11:3-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011%3A3-16&version=NIV) *" .. But every woman who prays .. with her head uncovered dishonors her head. ... Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? ..."*

In the Corinthian, women wore a head covering as a symbol of submission to their husbands. Paul is affirming this practice, where not doing this would send a bad signal to the culture at large. In today's culture, we do not view a head covering as a sign of submission to authority. But the overall theme of the verses is presenting how God has given roles that we need to follow. [^3]


### Other
#### Rape
The following verses seems to condon rape:

- *"If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives."* - Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (NIV)

What is happening is the women are being protected. This was over three thousand years ago. Women could not own property and with no husband or father could be destitute. If not married and had sex with another man, they were deemed of lesser value. There were very few options available to a woman at that time. In other cases, rape called for the death of the man. [^4]

#### Selling Daughter
The following verse, at first glance, can be viewed as offensive. How can one justify the "selling" of one's daughter?

- *“When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do. 8 If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has broken faith with her. 9 If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter. 10 If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights. 11 And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money.* Exodus 21:7-11 (ESV)

In Leviticus 25:39, a Jew would be sold as a servant if he "becomes poor". It would be in only extreme circumstances when a man would sell his daughter, and then his purpose would surely be to provide for her and to give her better prospects for the future. [^5]

The following observations provide more context to this command [^5]:

- The transaction is happening within men of a "covenant community".
- The daughter has been placed in a position of tremendous security.
- A Hebrew woman could not be permanently purchased; she could only be adopted.
- If the man does not fulfill his responsibility, she will be completely free.

## Diet
By some estimates, there are [613 different Old Testament laws](https://www.gotquestions.org/613-commandments.html). In Leviticus chapter 11 there is a list of food restrictions that God gave the nation of Israel. For example,

- *"And the pig, because it parts the hoof and is cloven-footed but does not chew the cud, is unclean to you."* - 11:7 (ESV)
- *"All fyling insects that walk on all fours are to be regared as unclean by you."* 11:20 (NIV)

With the arrival of Jesus, a new covenant was established - "[law of Christ](https://www.gotquestions.org/law-of-Christ.html)". The New Testament captures now how we *worship* and are set apart to be *holy*. The *dietary* laws, *worship rituals*, and *sacrifices* are no longer applicable.

And specifically for food, Jesus declared all foods clean - *"For it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)* - Mark 7:19 (NIV)

The laws for Israel were for being "distinct and set apart" for God. They are to be different than their surrounding culture. The new covenant establishes how **followers of Christ are set apart**. Christ fulfilled the laws,  and laws carried forward are explicitly captured in the New Testament.

The laws- *dietary, Sabbath, civil, and ceremonial* - that are carried forward from the Old Testament are <u>explicitly</u> captured in the New Testament.

## Slavery
Verses like the following can be misinterpreted that God endorses slavery:

- *“When a man sells his daughter as a slave, ..."* Exodus 21:7-11 (ESV)
- *"Whey you buy a Hebrew slave, .."* Exodus 21:2
- *"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ."* Ephesians 6:5

In the Old Testament and the New Testament, slavery is wrong - Exodus 21:16 "Anyone who kidnaps someone is to be put to death, ..." (NIV). God is giving instructions to regulate a preexisting way of life that was pervasive at the time. Slavery was everywhere in the ancient world. Slaves during ancient times were servants, allowing people to take care of their basic needs. [^6]

Slavery has been going on since the beginning, the *fall of man*. During the New Testament time, 30% of the population were some sort of Bondservant (i.e. working off their debt). An evil version of slavery (race-based) was legal at the beginning of the United States, until the end of the Civil War in 1865 - 13th Amendment. There are estimates that 40 million people are living in slavery today.
