*Culture* is a set of shared beliefs, acceptable behavior, and other "norms" such as the arts, laws, and different customs that a group follows. [Wikipedia definition of culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture).

## Critical Theory
As defined by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory), *Critical theory* is any approach to humanities and social philosophy that focuses on society and culture to attempt to reveal, critique, and challenge power structures.


### Its History
**Critical Theory** (aka *Critical Social Theory*) began in the early 1920s (**100+** years) with the Frankfurt School [^1].  Critical Theory is an umbrella category that captures all of the theories [^2]:

- Postcolonialism
- Critical Pedagogy
- Marxism
- Queer Theory
- Critical Race Theory
- Feminist theory (2nd and 3rd wave)
- Neo-Marxism
- Etc.

Critical theory has expanded from its origins in the Frankfurt School:[^3]
- is present in multiple disciplines, such as politics, economics, etc.
- focuses on how **power** (i.e. wealth, status, etc.) produces inequalities
- addressing the economy, race, class, gender, sexuality, education, etc.
- is committed to taking **actions** to address vs just describing

:::info
**Critical Theory** is multi-disciplines, focusing on how **power creates inequalities**.

#### Karl Marx (1818-1883)

Here's a concise summary of Karl Marx in [3-4 bullet points [p]](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/A-very-short-z4PIgdBlQdmAYAA48j4ohw#1):

- German philosopher, economist, and revolutionary socialist (1818-1883)
- Co-authored "The Communist Manifesto" and wrote "Das Kapital," critiquing capitalism and advocating for communism
- Developed Marxism, a theory centered on class struggle, historical materialism, and the exploitation of workers under capitalism
- His ideas have significantly influenced modern political and economic thought, inspiring various socialist and communist movements worldwide.

#### The Frankfurt School (1930+)

[Summary of the Frankfurt School [p]](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Provide-a-short-Ld8AhQOLRHmDJjbJisMP4Q):

- A group of influential German philosophers and social theorists associated with the Institute for Social Research at Goethe University Frankfurt, active from the 1930s onward.
- Developed critical theory, combining Marxist analysis with insights from psychoanalysis and other disciplines to critique modern capitalist society and culture.
- Key figures include Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, and Jürgen Habermas.
- Influential in various fields, including sociology, philosophy, cultural studies, and media criticism, with enduring impact on social and political thought.
- In 1935, the Institute for Social Research relocated to Columbia University in New York City, where it remained affiliated until 1949. This move provided a crucial safe haven for the Frankfurt School scholars fleeing Nazi Germany and allowed them to continue their work in the United States.

:::warning
Like Marx, many members of the school saw the destruction of the **nuclear family** and the eradication of traditional **sexual morality** as crucial to human liberation. [^4]
:::

#### Michel Foucault (1926-1984)
[Foucault's ideas [p]](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/provide-a-brief-overview-of-mi-zjlqFpfqTO6D2t5GJbamoA) have had a profound impact across various disciplines :
- Social Sciences: He is the most cited author in the social sciences.
- Critical Theory: His work has influenced feminism, queer theory, and postcolonial studies.
- Political Thought: Foucault challenged traditional notions of power and governance

#### Others
The following are some of the past individuals who had a huge impact on Western culture:


- `Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712 - 1778)` - An influential 18th-century Genevan philosopher, writer, and composer who played a significant role in shaping modern political, economic, and educational thought [[p]](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/provide-a-brief-overview-2-3-s-a5GIsjVhT4uurU8ar338Vw).
  - philosophy centered on the concept that humans are inherently good but corrupted by society, and he sought ways to preserve human freedom in an increasingly interdependent world
- `Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)` - German philosopher, cultural critic, and philologist of the late 19th century [[p]](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/provide-a-brief-overview-2-4-s-yAt3bnvUR5a53ZQ9uQwh0Q).
  - He is known for his radical critiques of traditional morality, religion, and philosophy, as well as his concepts of the *"death of God"*.
  - Profound impact on Western philosophy and modern intellectual history, influencing fields such as existentialism, postmodernism, and psychology
- `Charles Darwin (1809 - 1882)` - English naturalist renowned for formulating the theory of evolution through natural selection. His pivotal work, *On the Origin of Species*, published in 1859 [[p]](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/provide-a-brief-overview-2-4-s-Je_GokPZQemnuMlyFwpdWQ).
  - Darwin's ideas fundamentally transformed biological science and our understanding of life's diversity on Earth.
- `Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)` - An Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis [[p]](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/brief-overview-2-4-sentences-o-ak49JrY0QVac9qzr1xhteg).
  - Developed influential concepts such as the unconscious mind, the id/ego/superego model of the psyche, dream analysis, and psychosexual development.
  - Theories and therapeutic techniques, though controversial, had a profound impact on psychology, psychiatry, and Western thought in the 20th century
- `Sexual Revolution (1960 - 1970s)` - A social movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality [[p]](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/brief-overview-2-4-sentences-o-pzpp3TW1RlisaY0iFwMDgw).
  - It led to greater acceptance of sexual expression outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships, including premarital sex, homosexuality, and alternative forms of sexuality

The cultural conditions that made both gay marriage and transgender ideology first plausible and then normative have been developing over hundreds of years. [*Carl Trueman. The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self, page 25*]
:::

### Core Ideas
*Contemporary Critical Theory* (CCT) captures the <u>ideas</u> unifying the theories [^5]:

1. **`The Social binary`** - Society is divided into dominant/privileged/oppressor groups based on race, gender, sexuality, etc.
2. **`Hegemonic power`** - Oppression includes how dominant social groups impose their values, traditions, and norms, such that they are viewed as natural (i.e. God ordained).
3. **`Lived experience`** - The lived experience of oppressed groups can be prioritized over objective evidence.
4. **`Social justice`** - The concern with the transformation of society to empower the oppressed.

### Critical Race Theory (CRT)
It originated from *critical legal theories* that argued that individual justices were motivated not only by personal whims but by social forces. Thus, law should be understood primarily through the lens of social power. [^6]

#### Central Ideas to CRT:
The following are the central themes: [^7]

1. **Racism is everywhere**. It is a new form <u>not based on racial hate</u> but on the structures in society (e.g. "racism never goes away").
2. **Racism is concealed in colorblindness, meritocracy, and individualism**. These are mechanisms that preserve the racial status quo.
3. **Lived experience is important to understanding racism**.
4. **Racism is one of many systems of oppression**. CRT analysis of racism can not be separated from sexism, heterosexism, classism, and other forms of oppression. One cannot apply CRT *"just to race"*. 

#### Leaders

- Derick Bell - Considered the godfather of CRT. First black tenured law professor at Harvard Law School. Taught until 1980.
- Kimberle' Crenshaw - Student of Derick Bell, professor at UCLA School of Law.
- Richard Delgado - An American legal scholar and one of the founders of CRT, Professor of Law at Seattle University School of Law.
- Robin DiAngelo - PhD in multicultural education, wrote bestseller "White Fragility".
- Ibram Kendi - PhD in African American studies, wrote "How to Be an Antiracist".

#### Slavery
Some history on slavery: [^8]
- Slavery is often dated starting on August **1619** at the beginning in the American colonies.
- From **1525 to 1866** (341 years), **`12.5`** million Africans were shipped to North/South America and the Caribbean. They traveled in horrific conditions and many died (~ 10%).
- Note that the US founding documents only applied to whites.
- Abolition of slavery after the Civil War - **Thirteenth Amendment in 1865**.
- [Jim Crow area [p]](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/How-long-did-3DH1vZwZTC.16wTSEDIvAQ#1):
  - End of Reconstruction in 1877 with the withdrawal of federal troops
  - Supreme Court's decision in *Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)* allowing racial segregation
  - This led to widespread discrimination.
  - Eventually, the Civil Rights Act of **1964** ended these official practices.
- **346 years** of slavery, exclusion from Constitutional rights, Block codes, and Jim Crow laws had a huge impact on the Black community. [^8]

:::info
The term *Jim Crow* came from a theatrical character (used blackface) in the early 1830s and eventually evolved to a derogatory term for Blacks and then to a label representing racial segregation and discrimination.
:::

### Queer Theory
The central organizing feature of queer theory is the **rejection of all norms** and the destabilization of all categories. [^9]


#### Core Ideas
The following four core ideas are promoted by queer theory: [^10]

1. **Sex Versus Gender** - they are not the same thing.
2. **Gender as a Complex Category** - gender is socially constructed.
3. **Gender and Intersectionality** - sex, gender, sexuality, race, class, etc. are interconnected.
4. **Deconstruction of Norms** - norms are oppressive and should be deconstructed.

:::warning
"Believe gender is socially constructed. That gender was created in order to subordinate women and justify male power within society". [^10]
:::

#### Leaders
- Judith Bulter - Berkeley professor. 1990 Book *Gender Trouble*. Believes gender is an illusion.

#### History
The following notes: [^11]
- 1996 bipartisan support for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited same-sex marriage.
- 2015 US Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in the United States
- Gallup poll 2012 showed that ~ 3.5% identified as LGBT.
- In 2021 now 7.1% identified as LGBT.


### Shared Truths

The following are shared truths: [^12]

- Race is a social construct. Race was developed as a category in the 16th & 17th centuries
- We do not live in a post-racial society
- Colorblindness is not the best approach to racism
- Some aspects of gender expression are socially constructed
- Norms are often invisible and may not be legitimate or universal
- Hegemonic power does exist. The following are some examples:
   -  Hollywood in regard to beauty
   -  Universities' adoption and promotion of Critical theory (Ironically)
   -  DEI at corporations
- Unjust systems can exist
- Lived experiences can influence our access to truth

Some of the benefits [^13]:

- Understanding more on how power works in a society
- Forces people to review the history of marginalized people (slavery and Jim Crow, Native Americans during the Indian boarding school movement, etc.)
- Forces the consideration of oppression and its lingering effects on society

### Problems with the Ideas
Christianity and critical theory may agree that various problems exist, but they do not agree on what the fundamental problem is. [^14]

:::warning
Critical theory worldview is that the primary <u>problem</u> is not **sin**, but **oppression**. The dominant groups have imposed their norms (beliefs) on society. The <u>solution</u> is through **activism**, not **redemption**. Critical theory is its own **religion**! [^15]
:::

#### Hegemonic Power as Oppressive
Believes that whoever controls the ideology controls the society. Thus, any *dominant norms* already established must be removed.

 - Makes the assumption that <u>no</u> social norms are natural/God-ordained. And that <u>all</u> social hierarchies are unjust and oppressive. [^16]
 - Any reference to scriptures is a means to maintain dominance (abortion, same-sex marriage, etc.)
 - View God as the ultimate Oppressor [^17]

:::tip
As Christians, we believe norms do exist and are ordained by God. For example, the concept of <u>universal human rights and dignity</u>.
:::

#### Live Experience

- No one, regardless of their identity, can contradict any claims of a marginalized person. [^18]
- View evangelical theological claims as mechanisms to accrue political power and privilege. [^19]

:::tip
Scripture-informed reason should be the final arbiter of truth. [^18]
:::

#### Privilege
Through the social binary, everyone is categorized into a *privileged* and *non-privileged* group. This is especially true when applied to what is called *white privilege*. The group with the most *norms* in society is automatically viewed as the one with all of the power and thus will use it to dominate others.

It is acknowledged that some groups still are provided advantages over others. And we still do not live in a *post-racial society*. There have been numerous studies showing disadvantages to people of color regarding hiring, non-lethal uses of force by police, and hate crimes. [^20]

But the way Critical theory defines privilege has many problems:

- Majority privilege does not automatically mean systemic injustice (i.e. foods geared toward the majority). [^21]
- Marriage as a union between one man and woman is good and just. This is not an oppressive norm. [^22]
- Critical theorists often ignore the overriding advantage of wealth. [^23]
- Ignore the advantages of the structure of a family with two biological parents. Study after study shows that this family background decreases the chances of negative outcomes (i.e. prison, teen pregnancy, etc.) [^24]

:::warning
*"Intersectionality at the functional level attempts to co-opt and appropriate past oppression from a past iteration of a group and apply it to the modern iteration of the group. In many ways, this is a **fraud**."* [^25]
:::

#### Identity
CCT is based on a sharp division between groups - Oppressor and Oppressed (Social Binary). This grouping is the most important thing, and it is demanded for the sake of identifying politics. Anything that brings people together, outside of their special groups - race, sexual desires, gender, etc. - **is not accepted**.

Christianity's common dominators are:
- Made in God's image (Gen 1:27)
- We are all sinners (Rom 3:10-12)
- Everyone needs redemption in Christ (Rom 3:23-24)
- All are equal in Christ (Gal 3:28, Col 3:11)

:::tip
The Christian life must recognize our shared humanity, our shared sinfulness, our shared need for a Savior, and our shared identity in Christ. [^26]
:::

#### CRT
:::warning
CRT is committed to the view that **human law** is <u>not</u> grounded in a supernatural divine law and does <u>not</u> express universal moral truths. [^27]
:::

- Martin Luther King Jr. appealed to the traditional Christian view of the law. He did not dismiss the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution but rather appealed to them as the basis for the civil rights of Black Americans. [^28]
- CRT has expanded into other areas, beyond legal, that they believe are controlled by White racial power - education, science, and even <u>theology</u>. [^29]
- Any dominant norm is viewed to be a social construct that functions to preserve White racial power. [^30]
- A common concept/belief is that disparities are proof of systemic racism.
- The term `whiteness` is now redefined to mean a system of privilege that allocates social benefits.

:::tip
Christians must insist that every doctrine should be judged based on Scripture, **not** based on the supposed privilege of its proponents. [^30]
:::

To hold a people based on skin color guilty of the sins of nonrelatives who might have occupied the same location is deeply unbiblical. This approach is a dark path to endless guilt. [^31]

But if reparations are positioned not as *white ancestral guilt* (sin and blame), but instead as a matter of civil repair, a case might be able to be made. [^31]

#### Queer Theory
Historical Christian Understanding [^32]:
- Male and female are good, God-ordained categories
- Men and women differ in their God-ordained roles
- Marriage is the union of a man and a woman
- Sex is permissible only within marriage

[^32]: Critical Dilemma. 377.

:::tip
We can hold a traditional biblical sexual ethic, not out of hatred, but because this is God's design for gender and sexuality. Any rejection of this is going against God's purposes and will hurt humans. [^33]
:::

[^33]: Critical Dilemma. 376.

Some aspects of gender expression are socially constructed. But Queer theory claims **all** aspects of gender are socially constructed, and that gender is nothing more than a human convention. [^34]

[^34]: Critical Dilemma. 384.

:::warning
"Within the realm of consensual sexual activity, there is virtually no sexual practice that is not just tolerated but valorized by queer theory". [^35]

[^35]: Critical Dilemma. 398.

The goal of queer theory is to **break down all sexual norms**. If allowed, it will impact our understanding of sin, salvation, the church, Scripture, good and evil, and the nature of God. [^36]
:::

[^36]: Critical Dilemma. 404.

#### Flawed Statements
The following is a list of popular statements that are derived from Critical Theory:

- "People of Color in the  US are oppressed." [^37]
  - The term `oppression` has been **redefined** to <u>not</u> mean personal cruelty or prejudice, but rather the norms that keep white people in power.
- "Sin is Oppression." [^38]
  - Sin is breaking God's laws.
- "Straight White males need to listen." [^39]
  - This is based on the belief that they are at the top of privilege and are blinded to social reality. Thus, any dissent is shut down and everything stated is "unchallengeable". It is the **quality of the idea** vs the **quality of the identity** that matters.
- "The Bible was written from the perspective of the oppressed." [^40]
  - Some were oppressed (NT Jews) and some were not (David, Moses, etc). Marginize people do not have special insight into Scripture.
- "Whiteness is wickedness." [^41]
  - The term has been redefined and carries a very negative moral connotation. Very bad usage of a term and does not promote unity.
- "Justice is part of the gospel." [^42]
  - The gospel is about salvation, not about acts that do not save us.
- "There can be no reconciliation without justice." [^43]
  - We are reconciled as believers to each other through Christ.
- "Christianity is about liberation from oppression." [^44]
  - No, it is about being cleansed from sin and forgiven.

### Why Appealing
We now live in a *Victimhood culture*, versus a Dignity culture (20th century) or Honor culture (19th century). The more of a victim you are, the more social points you have. [^45]

[^45]: Critical Dilemma. 438-439.

There is also a **moral factor** that appeals to many people - the "belief" that they are providing protection of the vulnerable: [^46]
- Critical race theory protects people of color from white supremacy
- Feminism protects women from patriarchy
- Queer theory people are liberated from the gender binary

[^46]: Critical Dilemma. 441.

:::tip
Compassion needs to be tried to truth [^47]
:::

[^47]: Critical Dilemma. 446.

Secular liberalism is procedural. By contrast, Critical theory provides a worldview about reality. It gives purpose, good against evil. [^48].
