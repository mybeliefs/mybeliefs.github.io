## Historic Christianity

### Apostle’s Creed
- ~390 AD, an early statement of the Christian core beliefs
- Unity for all Christians

> *I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth;
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord,
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;
He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.*


### Evangelical
- The gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ
- Born again experience
- Authority of the Bible; God’s revelation to man
- ~ 285 million, about 13% of the total Christian population

### Calvinism
- [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism) is also called **Reform** - the practice of John Calvin. Broke away from Catholic Church, but differed from [Lutherans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism)
- Around 16th century
- Recent leaders: R. C. Sproul, Keller, John Piper
- Core beliefs:
  - God communicates knowledge through the Word of God
  - Bible is true. Conservative followers believe the bible is inerrant (incapable of error of falsehood in every palace).
  - Note: PCUSA believes the Bible is not the word of God but only human reports of the revealed Jesus Christ

#### Terms
- `Gospel` - What God did for us, in Christ Jesus, to redeem us so we could have a relationship with Him. Good news.
- `Covenant` - A binding commitment. In this context God’s binding commitment to us, his people. To restore us. Used in the Old Testament 280 times, New Testament ~33 times.

### Arminianism

## Difficulties

### Questions

#### Deuteronomy
- Killing enemies including women and children (2:31-34, 17:7, 20:10-18)
- Stoning people to death if they worship other gods (17:2-7)
- A king must not take "many" wives .. (17:17)
- A rebellious Son being stoned to death (21:18-21)

#### Common

1. Why is it wrong to be gay? It is not their choice (for most of them). Who would choose to be gay?
2. Why do people go to hell?
3. The Bible seems to contradict itself
4. Did the whale really swallow Jonah?

### Old Testament
Address questions that occur when reading old testament narratives. Like when Israel instructed to kill everyone, including women and children. Taking revenge, etc. Also, some of the laws, customs, etc., seem weird.

- Wars of the Old Testament. Today we have laws (Geneva Convention 1949) that protect persons taking no active part in the war, etc. These would be considered war crimes. But the Old Testament instructs armies of Israel to destroy not only opposing forces but also women and children. 1 Sam 15:2-3 {.. totally destroy, .. put to death men and women, children, and infants, ..”}

We can ask honest questions about the book we rely on!

### Questions Skeptics Ask
Reference - [discovery - questions skeptics ask about the God of the Old Testament](http://web001.rbc.org/pdf/discovery-series/questions-skeptics-ask-about-the-god-of-the-old-testament.pdf)

Notes:
- Discoveries have shown the kind of culture that existed then. Multiple idols, institutionalized prostitution, child sacrifices, etc.
- The Canaanites and others knew about the God of Israel (i.e. miracles, etc.)
- If the Canaanite culture was left undisturbed it would have continued influencing the area
- Everyone dies, some suddenly, some old, but everyone dies. We can’t see the whole picture. If we trust God we have to believe that in the end, He will right the wrongs of the ages.
- God has the right to be gracious to whom He wants. The doctrine of Election.
- God of both incomprehensible love and fearsome wrath
- The God of the new testament shows similar characteristics. In Acts, the couple suddenly dies when withholding their proceeds from selling property. The book of Revelations has lots of destruction in it.
- Sometimes God strikes down people immediately (Uzzah when he touched the ark - 2 Sam. 6:1-10), and other times the consequences seem limited (King David sins). But in the context of eternity, the time and manner of a person’s death can look very different than it does from where we sit.
- The term “hate” in Hebrew culture also meant to choose someone over another. The person not chosen sometimes is stated as “hated”, but not in the sense of our English use of the word. For example in the NT Lk 14:26 “If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, ..”.
- The OT view of women. In Jewish society, women did not hold an equal place. May be considered a social concession, tolerated by God in the light of the times. Although Jewish women were much better off than their surrounding neighbors.

> We need to view God with both fear, awe, and love. He is the maker and we don’t get to understand everything. But he has revealed much to us.
