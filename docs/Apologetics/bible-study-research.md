## The Cannon
There are 27 books on the New Testament.

- `Canon` - books that are considered by Christians as authoritative.
- `Apocrypha` (uh.paa.kruh.fuh) - books not accepted as part of the canon.

:::info
The Council of Nicaea (Ni.c.a) in **AD 325**, called by Constantine, did **not** determine the canon. Rather the [Nicene Creed](https://www.gotquestions.org/Nicene-creed.html) was written, addressing a group led by a man named Arius who did not believe in the divinity of Christ. Constantine's concern was political unity.
:::

### Criteria
The following criteria were used to confirm which books to include: [^1][p100-105]

- Authorship (Apostolicity) - who wrote the book
- Orthodoxy - were the teachings consistent with the existing accepted books
- Catholicity (Cath.a.li.city) - usage of the church as a whole

Always recognized as authoritative: [^1][p103]
- Matthew, Mark, Luke, John
- Acts
- Paul's 13 epistles
- 1 Peter
- 1 John

Luke's was closely associated with Paul.

### Not so fast

- Hebrew - author was not known
- James - was concerned with orthodoxy (i.e. works)
- 2 Peter - greek was so different
- 2 & 3 John - were very short
- Jude - referenced to noncanonical book (v9)

:::info
**AD 367** Easter Letter written by [Athanasius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_letter), who was the first person to authoritatively list the 27 books. [^1][p113]
:::

Note that there were other book references that were not included in the Canon (i.e. *Wisdom of Solomon, Shepherd of Hermas*).

## Textual Criticism
The **original documents** written by the New Testament authors are called `autographs`. We do not have copies of these documents. Copies of these documents were made by individuals called `scribes`. There were no printing presses in the first century. The printing press was invented in 1440 by Johannes Gutenberg. So many copies of copies of the documents were made by scribes by hand.

**Textual criticism** is the process/science of comparing ancient documents and deriving the most actuate text based on all of the manuscripts that have been discovered.

### Manuscripts
A `manuscript` is a copy of a **book** or a small set of **verses** from a book. The earliest manuscripts were written using scrolls that were long sheets of parchment or papyrus and rolled up for storage. As the church grew pages stitched together, called [codexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex), were used.

The earliest known New Testament manuscript is the [Rylands Library Papyrus P52](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylands_Library_Papyrus_P52). It contains a fragment of the Gospel of John *18:31-33, 37-38* and is estimated to date back to **125 AD**.

The oldest **complete manuscripts** that contain the entire New Testament date back to the **4th century** are the [Vaticanus (va.ta.k.nus) and Sinaitcus (sin.ni.ta.cus)](https://www.gotquestions.org/Codex-Sinaiticus-Vaticanus.html). These are two of the primary manuscripts used for textual criticism. [^1][p144]

Approximate number of [Greek manuscripts](https://g.co/bard/share/f5e8971ef898) of the New Testament is **5,800**:

Type | Number of manuscripts
-----| ---------------------
Complete manuscripts | 260
Fragments | 5,5540

Manuscripts can be categorized into a `text-type`. A text-type is based on location and common characteristics.

Name | Description | Characteristics | Date
---- | ----------- | --------------- | ------
Alexandrian	| Oldest and most reliable. Two of the primary Greek manuscripts used in testual criticism. [^1][p144]| 	Brevity, Accuracy	| 2nd - 4th century AD
Byzantine	| Most common (~95%) [^1][p145]	| Longer readings Harmonizes the Gospels	| 4th - 10th century AD
Western	| Free and easy style. The [Latin Vulgate](https://www.gotquestions.org/Latin-Vulgate.html) is based on. [^1][p144] | 	Paraphrased, Expanded, Unique readings	| 2nd - 4th century AD
Caesarean |	Early text-type |	Mixed readings (Alexandrian & Byzantine)	| 3rd - 5th century AD
Majority Text |	Term often used for Byzantine	| Common readings, Not the only majority text-type	| 4th - 10th century AD


### Variants
Variants are differences between two copies of a text contained in different manuscripts. There are 138,213 words in the New Testament and based on all of the ~6,000 manuscripts there are about 400,000 variants. But only **1%** are meaningful. [^1][p141]

:::tip
From the <u>*5,600*</u> Greek manuscripts, there are ~**400,000** variants (out of **138,213** words), with **99%** variants making no difference. The remaining **1%** that are *viable* and *meaningful* does not change a single biblical doctrine. [^1] [p141]
:::

Notes:
- Spelling differences make up about 70% (~280k). [^1][p134]
- Scribes were more willing to *"add"* text than *"remove"* text, often to add clarification. [^1][p133]
- The *meaningful* (changes meaning) and *viable* (might be original) are **less than 1%** (~4k) [^1][p141]
- "... probably only **`373`** places where a variant is meaningful and viable". [^1][p153]
- The King James translation uses the **Byzantine** text-type, which [contains a number of errors and omissions, and it does not always reflect the earliest and most reliable readings](https://g.co/bard/share/e59434b663f2).
- The two major variants that were <u>not</u> in the autographs: [^1][p146]
   - `John 7:53-8:11` - The woman caught in adultery (i.e. "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her".)
   - `Mark 16:9-20` - .. they will pick up snakes with their hands

## Translations
Challenges with translating from the Greek language:
- a word almost always has multiple meanings
- a word in one language has <u>no exact</u> equivalent in another language
- thus, all translations require interpretation

Translation | Category | Approach
---------| ----------- | -----
`ESV` | Formal | Adhere as closely as possible to the grammatical structures of the original language, altering the translation only when necessary to convey meaning.
`NIV` | Dynamic | Tries to discover the author's original intent and then convey the same meaning in the target language.
`NLT` | Natural Language | Tries to repeat the meaning of the Greek in the most natural English style possible.

:::tip
Not a single verse translated in the Bible is word for word. [^1][p205]

### Notes
- One theme: 66 books; written over 1600 years; by 40 authors of different ages, 3 continents;
- The best-selling book in history
- 300 prophecies about Jesus alone; written a thousand years before. The law in Israel was that a prophet had to be correct 100% of the time or put to death
- Other books:
  - Koran was written by Mohammed
  - Analects of Confucius written Confucius
  - Writings of Buddha were written by Buddha

### Terms
- `Exegesis` (x.sa.jesus) - the study of scripture to discover the original intended meaning
- `Hermeneutics` (her.men.new.tics) - seeking the contemporary relevance of ancient texts
- `Genre` (john.ruh) - a category of music or literature similar in form, style, or subject
- Theory of translation:
  - *Formal equivalence* - keep as close to the form of the Hebrew or Greek language (NASB)
  - *Functional equivalence* - keep the meaning of the Hebrew or Greek but put their words and idioms into a normal way of saying in English (NIV)

### Exegesis (original meaning)

#### Historical Context
Reconstruct the situation (occasion) the author is speaking to
- consult Bible dictionary
- read the whole letter in 1 sitting
- read and re-read
- working outline

#### Literary Context
-Think in paragraphs
- Summarize the content for each paragraph/section
- Try to explain why the author is making his point

#### Problem Passages
- Understand they were not written to us
- if God wanted us to know would have made it clear

### Hermeneutics (how it applies)
- A text cannot mean what it never could have meant to its author or intended reader. Requires good exegesis to clarify this.
- When the intended reader(s) situation is the same as ours today then the text means the same to us (comparable situations)
- Discovering a clear principle being applied to a situation that can span time. Applying this principle needs to be consistent.

Guidelines for identifying issues/principles that are culturally relative or still applicable:
- Distinguish between core principles versus peripheral
- Inherently moral issues
- NT contains a consistent theme

### The Gospels
- Contain a narrative of Jesus’ life and his sayings
- Mark was believed to have written 1st. It was rewritten by others (Matthew and Luke) for different communities (different needs). John was written for another set of reasons.
- The context of the gospels is 1st-century Judaism
- Jesus uses both parables and hyperbole (*exaggeration, not to be taken literally*) in his teaching style
- The original content was carried on verbally as individual stories for ~ 30 years, before being written down.
- These “stories” were put into context by the writers, this way they show up in different locations in the gospels
- Always ask if the story was for (i) the disciples (ii) a larger group or (iii) his opponents
- Synoptic gospels: Most likely Mark wrote his gospel 1st, from Peter’s accounts, and Matthew and Luke had access to it.
- Each gospel is influenced by the target audience. For example, John was toward “Jesus the Messiah”. Thus, his content was largely selected from Jesus’ ministry in Judea and Jerusalem (page 141).

#### Kingdom of God
- `Eschatological` - Having to do with the end of times
- `The Kingdom of God` is the time of God’s rule. No more sickness, sin, etc. The old is done away with. The thought about the Messiah was to bring the kingdom. They watched Jesus - he did miracles, drove out demons, etc. Jesus announced the coming of the kingdom was at hand. But suddenly he was crucified. But then 3 days later he rose from the dead. But then he disappeared again and the Spirit was given. We are at the beginning (the cross) of the end(2nd coming):
  - Made righteousness by his death <=> but not yet perfected
  - Have peace <=> but not yet full peach
  - **The tension between the in-between state**

#### Parables
- They are <u>not</u> meant to be mysteries, only for some inner circle to interpret
- The challenge is not so much understanding them but letting them alter your behavior.
- Need to understand the original audience of the parable.
- A parable is a story with a beginning and an end; to make a point.
- Often the listener already had the context, based on their culture, to understand the “punch line” of the story (message).
- Allegories are different. A parable has an intended response. The points of reference are not the purpose, just helping in getting the response.

### The Epistles
- All `21` NT books except 4 Gospels, Acts, and Revelations
- Most were written as letters to individuals (an example not to an individual is Hebrews)
- Most were written for a specific occasion to the reader(s). The focus was on fixing a behavior, doctrine, etc. The primary purpose was not to describe theology.
