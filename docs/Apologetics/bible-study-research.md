### Terms
- `Exegesis` (x.sa.jesus) - the study of scripture to discover the original intended meaning
- `Hermeneutics` (her.men.new.tics) - seeking the contemporary relevance of ancient texts
- `Genre` (john.ruh) - a category of music or literature similar in form, style, or subject
- Theory of translation:
  - *Formal equivalence* - keep as close to the form of the Hebrew or Greek language (NASB)
  - *Functional equivalence* - keep the meaning of the Hebrew or Greek but put their words and idioms into a normal way of saying in English (NIV)

### Exegesis (original meaning)

#### Historical Context
Reconstruct the situation (occasion) the author is speaking to
- consult Bible dictionary
- read the whole letter in 1 sitting
- read and re-read
- working outline

#### Literary Context
-Think in paragraphs
- Summarize the content for each paragraph/section
- Try to explain why the author is making his point

#### Problem Passages
- Understand they were not written to us
- if God wanted us to know would have made it clear

### Hermeneutics (how it applies)
- A text cannot mean what it never could have meant to its author or intended reader. Requires good exegesis to clarify this.
- When the intended reader(s) situation is the same as ours today then the text means the same to us (comparable situations)
- Discovering a clear principle being applied to a situation that can span time. Applying this principle needs to be consistent.

Guidelines for identifying issues/principles that are culturally relative or still applicable:
- Distinguish between core principles versus peripheral
- Inherently moral issues
- NT contains a consistent theme

### The Gospels
- Contain a narrative of Jesus’ life and his sayings
- Mark was believed to have written 1st. It was rewritten by others (Matthew and Luke) for different communities (different needs). John was written for another set of reasons.
- The context of the gospels is 1st-century Judaism
- Jesus uses both parables and hyperbole (*exaggeration, not to be taken literally*) in his teaching style
- The original content was carried on verbally as individual stories for ~ 30 years, before being written down.
- These “stories” were put into context by the writers, this way they show up in different locations in the gospels
- Always ask if the story was for (i) the disciples (ii) a larger group or (iii) his opponents
- Synoptic gospels: Most likely Mark wrote his gospel 1st, from Peter’s accounts, and Matthew and Luke had access to it.
- Each gospel is influenced by the target audience. For example, John was toward “Jesus the Messiah”. Thus, his content was largely selected from Jesus’ ministry in Judea and Jerusalem (page 141).

#### Kingdom of God
- `Eschatological` - Having to do with the end of times
- `The Kingdom of God` is the time of God’s rule. No more sickness, sin, etc. The old is done away with. The thought about the Messiah was to bring the kingdom. They watched Jesus - he did miracles, drove out demons, etc. Jesus announced the coming of the kingdom was at hand. But suddenly he was crucified. But then 3 days later he rose from the dead. But then he disappeared again and the Spirit was given. We are at the beginning (the cross) of the end(2nd coming):
  - Made righteousness by his death <=> but not yet perfected
  - Have peace <=> but not yet full peach
  - **The tension between the in-between state**

#### Parables
- They are <u>not</u> meant to be mysteries, only for some inner circle to interpret
- The challenge is not so much understanding them but letting them alter your behavior.
- Need to understand the original audience of the parable.
- A parable is a story with a beginning and an end; to make a point.
- Often the listener already had the context, based on their culture, to understand the “punch line” of the story (message).
- Allegories are different. A parable has an intended response. The points of reference are not the purpose, just helping in getting the response.

### The Epistles
- All `21` NT books except 4 Gospels, Acts, and Revelations
- Most were written as letters to individuals (an example not to an individual is Hebrews)
- Most were written for a specific occasion to the reader(s). The focus was on fixing a behavior, doctrine, etc. The primary purpose was not to describe theology.

## My Process

When I arrived at my office in the morning I spend time studying the scriptures and at times other related resources. I use a GitHub repository and tool called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to capture my notes, observations, etc.
