## Historical Quests
Referencing *Four Portraits*.

### Overview
- Many scholars do not believe in the content of Jesus as portrayed in the Bible. The accounts are not historical and are embellished by later Christians.
- The traditional view by the Church was the Bible was “inspired” and historically actuate and reliable. But this was challenged in the **17th and 18th centuries**, during the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment), where [Rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism) dominated the intellectual scene.
- As a result, books were written about Jesus, explaining away miracles.
- Different phases of books are grouped into Quests for Jesus.

### First Quest
- 1st book by Reimarus (professor) claimed Jesus thought he was a human messiah, to free his people from Roman control. When he died his disciples stole the body and began proclaiming his resurrection. Most scholars rejected this “fraud” approach. But other books were written, focused on explaining away miracles.
- The <u>liberal</u> Jesus - ethical teacher, the brotherhood of all human beings.

### No Quest
- Scholars claim “almost nothing” could be known about the historical Jesus.
- Extreme skepticism
- `Bultmann` (1900 - 1950) was a major influence on future scholars.
- The Gospels were filled with “myths”
- Eyewitnesses played almost no role in passing down the traditions about Jesus.
- The early church was *not interested in the Jesus of history*, but rather the Christ of faith

### New (Second) Quest
- Started by former students of Bultmann
- Not as radical, but use the same premises (*no miracles*, Christ of faith)
Jesus did not claim to be a Messiah and predict his death

### Third  Quest
- Used advances in biblical and archeological studies
- Includes the Jesus Seminar
  - Gospels have little historical value (~ 15% authentic concerning Jesus's sayings and deeds)
  - John’s gospel contains almost nothing authentic
  - Critical toward Gospels, but accepting of noncanonical sources
- The Jewishness of Jesus stressed
- Much of the Synoptic material is authentic, but still reservations about John
- Assume Mark written 1st, also another common source called Q (could be multiple sources, verbal, etc.).
- “One would likely conclude the historicity of most Gospel stories cannot be proven one way or the other”
- The most controversial is **how to deal with the supernatural?**
- All agree the “kingdom of God” was the central message of Jesus. But what did this mean?
- 5 main portraits of Jesus:
  - Wandering Cynic-like Philosopher
  - A Jewish Mystic or Spirit Person
  - A Social Revolutionary
  - An Eschatological Prophet
  - The Messiah

## Reliability (Trustworthy)
Sure the Gospels writers were biased but it does not make them uncredible historians.

> Who has the **burden of proof**?

- Luke claimed to be writing accurate history.
- Taught the greatest ethical system in the world.
- Suffered and died for their faith, would not be lying.
- Old Testament from Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts; New from Greek

### Terms
- `Postmodernism` rejects any one set of absolute truths
- `Presupposition`.  If you reject the supernatural (miracles) you will reject the Gospel's accounts. If you assume Jesus was a disillusioned Jewish preacher, you will reject the Gospels writing and explain away how the Church deified him.
- `Autographs` - original Gospel manuscripts

### Tradition
- Judaism carefully transmitted their oral traditions
- Preserved difficult sayings
- The Disciples were not deceivers

### Contradictions
- All of Jesus’s words are translated and paraphrased. He spoke in Aramaic, and the Gospels were written in Greek.
- There is no intent for verbatim representation, and the writers each had different emphases that were being made.
- Writers are selective in what content and details to add and omit.
- The order of sayings and events is often rearranged for theological reasons.
- Jesus probably taught the same theme on many different occasions.

### Authorship
The gospels were anonymous, names were not attached. In the 1st & 2nd centuries, it was a common understanding of the authors. In the 3rd century, the “named” gospels were firmly held.

- Matthew - Matthew, early tradition held by the early church, 1 of the 12 disciples
- John - John the beloved disciple, early tradition.
- Mark & Luke did not know Jesus personally

But now some scholars use “internal” evidence to question the authorship

We can assume that the early Christians were committed to truth, thus maintaining the names of two writers who did not personally know Jesus states a lot.

> But knowing “for sure” who wrote the Gospels is <u>not</u> that important.

### Dates
There is external and internal evidence used to *speculate* on the dates of the `autographs`. There are no absolutes on the dates. The external items are references to the gospels by other writings. A major internal item is *no mention of the fall of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.*

A majority of scholars hold the following ranges:

- Matthew: 65-85 A.D.
- Mark: 60-75 A.D.
- Luke: 65-95 A.D.
- John: 75-100 A.D.

### Sources
There were “written” sources and content passed down verbally. There are many theories concerning prior written sources and how there is duplication in Matthew and Luke - exactly verbatim.

- 20+ years of an oral tradition
- Mark was written first; as a source for Matthew and Luke. This is the consensus view (Four p51)
- `90%` of Mark’s content appears in Matthew and Luke.
- John’s content is 90% unique
- “Q” - a common source also, containing “common sayings” (*Four Portraits*, p52)

### Oral tradition
[Form Criticism](https://www.gotquestions.org/form-criticism.html) was developed in Germany in the twentieth century to assess the oral traditions of the gospel.
- Much of the approach developed by Rudolf Bultmann (did not believe in miracles)
- Assumed much of the stories (units) were from the early church, not Jesus

#### General comments:
- It was an “oral” culture during that time, a whole community
- Many of the sayings were oriented toward memorization
- There was a motivation for the early leaders to pass on the teachings accurately

### Specifics

#### Luke
- Attention to historical details
- Understood terms and titles of the political system

#### John
- Some of the differences again can be explained by the writer's freedom to tell the stories based on the purposes of the book.
- Does affirm the deity of Christ more than the Synoptics. But the Synoptics also refers to the “deity” implicit (i.e. forgiving sins).
