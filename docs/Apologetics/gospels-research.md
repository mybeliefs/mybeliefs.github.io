## Reliability (Trustworthy)
This section covers the reliability of the gospels.

### Authorship
The gospels were anonymous, names were not attached. In the 1st & 2nd centuries, it was a common understanding of the authors. In the 3rd century, the “named” gospels were firmly held.

- Matthew - Matthew, an early tradition held by the early church, 1 of the 12 disciples
- John - John the beloved disciple, early tradition.
- Mark & Luke did not know Jesus personally

However, some current scholars use “internal” evidence to question the authorship.

We can assume that the early Christians were committed to truth, thus maintaining the names of two writers who did not personally know Jesus would indicate this stance.

But knowing “for sure” who wrote the Gospels is <u>not</u> that important.

### Dates
There is external and internal evidence used to *speculate* on the dates of the `autographs`. There are no absolutes on the dates. The external items are references to the gospels by other writings. A major internal item is **no mention of the fall of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.**

A majority of scholars hold the following ranges: [^1]

- Matthew: `65-85` A.D.
- Mark: `60-75` A.D.
- Luke: `65-95` A.D.
- John: `75-100` A.D.

:::tip
Thus, written 30-70 years after the death of Jesus
:::

For slightly older dates proposed by non-Christians refer to Peter Williams book [^2].

### Sources
There were “written” sources and content passed down verbally. There are many theories concerning prior written sources and how there is duplication in Matthew and Luke - exactly verbatim. [^3]

- 20+ years of an oral tradition
- Mark was written first; as a source for Matthew and Luke. This is the consensus view `[p51]`.
- 90% of Mark’s content appears in Matthew and Luke.
- John’s content is 90% unique
- “Q” - a common source also, containing “common sayings” `[p52]`

Sure the Gospels writers were biased but it does not make them uncredible historians. Who has the **burden of proof**?

- Luke claimed to be writing accurate history.
- Taught the greatest ethical system in the world.
- Suffered and died for their faith, would not be lying.
- Old Testament from Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts; New from Greek.

#### Tradition
- Judaism carefully transmitted their oral traditions
- Preserved difficult sayings
- The Disciples were not deceivers

### Contradictions
There are many examples of "apparent" contradictions [^4] in the gospels. For example:

- Different timelines for the death of Jesus `[50]`
- Luke states only one of the thieves repented `[56]`
- How many angels were at the tomb `[58]`
- Jairus's daughter in Mark vs Matthew `[78]`

It is important to understand how the gospels were written. The authors knew more than what they wrote about and had a specific **purpose** for the content they provided. This controlled the *selection* and *arrangement* of the accounts. [^4] `[55]`

- There is no intent for verbatim representation, and the writers each had different emphases that were being made.
- Writers are selective in what content and details to add and omit.
- The order of sayings and events is often rearranged for theological reasons.
- Jesus probably taught the same theme on many different occasions.
- All of Jesus’s words are translated and paraphrased. He spoke in Aramaic, and the Gospels were written in Greek.

"The ancient writers were quite comfortable with simplification, paraphrasing, and approximations. They were even comfortable compressing two events into one. Granted, we do the same today, but ancients were even more willing to compress and simplify a story." [^4]`[75]`

"Harmonization asks if you can conceive of a situation in which both biblical accounts could be true, despite their obvious differences. It acknowledges that we often tell stories about the same events but from different points of view. We select material to share and arrange it in ways that help us achieve our goals. Perhaps we want to be strictly chronological. Or we want to group similar events together. Maybe we want to compare and contrast two events that are disconnected in time. These different versions are not errors or contradictions. They are simply a reflection of the way we tell stories." [^4]`[64]`

## Historical Quests

### Overview
- Many scholars do not believe in the content of Jesus as portrayed in the Bible. The accounts are not historical and are embellished by later Christians.
- The traditional view by the Church was the Bible was “inspired” and historically actuate and reliable. But this was challenged in the **17th and 18th centuries**, during the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment), where [Rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism) dominated the intellectual scene.
- As a result, books were written about Jesus, explaining away miracles.
- Different phases of books are grouped into Quests for Jesus.

### First Quest
- 1st book by Reimarus (professor) claimed Jesus thought he was a human messiah, to free his people from Roman control. When he died his disciples stole the body and began proclaiming his resurrection. Most scholars rejected this “fraud” approach. But other books were written, focused on explaining away miracles.
- The <u>liberal</u> Jesus - ethical teacher, the brotherhood of all human beings.

### No Quest
- Scholars claim that “almost nothing” could be known about the historical Jesus.
- Extreme skepticism
- `Bultmann` (1900 - 1950) was a major influence on future scholars.
- The Gospels were filled with “myths”
- Eyewitnesses played almost no role in passing down the traditions about Jesus.
- The early church was *not interested* in the **Jesus of history**, but rather the **Christ of Faith**

### New (Second) Quest
- Started by former students of Bultmann
- Not as radical, but use the same premises (*no miracles*, `Christ of Faith`)
Jesus did <u>not</u> claim to be a Messiah and predict his death

### Third  Quest
- Used advances in biblical and archeological studies
- Includes the [Jesus Seminar](https://www.str.org/w/the-jesus-seminar-under-fire)
  - Gospels have little historical value (~ 15% authentic concerning Jesus's sayings and deeds)
  - John’s gospel contains almost nothing authentic
  - Critical toward Gospels, but accepting of noncanonical sources (i.e. [Gospel of Thomas](https://www.gotquestions.org/gospel-of-Thomas.html))
- The Jewishness of Jesus stressed
- Much of the Synoptic material is authentic, but still reservations about John
- Assume Mark written 1st, also another common source called Q (could be multiple sources, verbal, etc.).
- “One would likely conclude the historicity of most Gospel stories cannot be proven one way or the other”
- The most controversial is **how to deal with the supernatural**
- All agree the “kingdom of God” was the central message of Jesus. But what did this mean?
- 5 main portraits of Jesus:
  - Wandering Cynic-like Philosopher
  - A Jewish Mystic or Spirit Person
  - A Social Revolutionary
  - An Eschatological Prophet
  - The Messiah
