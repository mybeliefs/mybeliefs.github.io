## Introduction

- Relevant today as it was during ancient times. But must understand the challenges of the people at the time they were written.
- Confronts each person with the question: (1) were we created to follow and fellowship with a loving God; or (2) life is random and the purpose is self-interest
- Pentateuch (“pen.ta.tuke”) - 1st 5 books of the Bible
- 40% of the OT content is narrative
- The New Testament writers viewed the Hebrew Scriptures as a **testimony to Jesus Christ**. Fulfilled the law, the Sacrifice, etc.

## Inspiration
> If the Bible is the word of God it `sits in judgment on man`; man is <u>not</u> capable of sitting in judgment on the Bible.

- Our premise dictates how we pursue issues
  - Product of humans - explain away miracles, etc
  - Inspired by God - careful investigation to resolve discrepancies
- Remarkable singleness and purpose of the `39 books`
- The Bible states that it is a revelation from God
- `Inerrancy` (freedom from error) of the autographs (original manuscripts)
  - God would not inspire a human author to write anything false
  - but we have **copyists’ errors** (handwritten copies have a slip of the pen -- typos -- spelling variants, etc.)
  - There is a big difference between a book wrong at the start and a document that was right at the start but miscopied
- Over 20k witnesses to the text of the NT
- No document of ancient times has so many copies
- No doctrine of Scripture has been affected by scribes' errors
- The **Bible is infallible as to truth**. Actuate to matters of history (i.e. Adam and Eve, Noah, etc.) and science. Jesus affirms Old Testament history.
- If the Bible is the word of God it sits in judgment on man; man is not capable of sitting in judgment on the Bible.

## Manuscripts

- some instances of the manuscripts that we have are a thousand years from the original writing
- Other manuscripts have been translated into Greek, Aramaic, or Latin
- Oldest manuscripts primary from Dead Sea caves

## Textual Criticism
- Focused on restoring the original text derived from all of the copies
- Also called *Lower Criticism*
- *Higher Criticism* is looking at issues related to authorship and integrity of the text
- The same types of errors found in ancient secular texts also have occurred in the copied manuscripts (i.e. transposing letters, etc.)
- Types of errors
  - A single letter that should have been written twice
  - duplicated letters
  - combining words into a single one
  - loss of a single word or letter
  - vowels, consonants mixed up
  - etc
- Standards by textual critics on how to reconstruct

## Canon of the Old Testament

- Canon - writings that conform to the rule of the standard of divine inspiration and authority
- **Septuagint** (*sep.tu.a.gint*) - the Greek version of the Old Testament (translated from Hebrew by Jewish scholars). Translated between 300-200 BC (at the time many of the Jews were losing their Hebrew language)
- Hebrew Scriptures were 39 books considered by the Jewish community to be canonical. The same set was accepted by the apostolic church (succession of the Church through the Apostles) and the Protestant churches. The Roman Church adds 14 books - called Apocrypha.
- **Apocrypha** (*a.poc.ra.ful**) - 14 books of the OT included in the Vulgate - Latin translation of the Bible commissioned by the Pope 4th-century).
  - NT authors never quoted or alluded to these books
- Councils simply acknowledged the divine inspiration of documents based on them already being accepted as divine by people when they were first composed.
- Two general views of the OT Canon
  - When the books were first written the authors indicate they are by divine authority, thus they are immediately accepted to be faithful. The books themselves claim to be inspired.
  - Don’t accept God’s supernatural inspiration (i.e. God spoke directly to Moses), then all self-references must be ruled out. Alternative theories on how the books were assembled in pieces over time are offered.

## Authorship of the Pentateuch
- `Diest` - non-religious person, but believes in a higher power or God
- `Documentary Theory` - 1st 5 books were collected over 500 years by multiple sources, long after Moses. The main documents are called JEDP. These were written by others, often conflicted, and were used to construct over time the Pentateuch
  - J for the name Jahweh/Yahweh
  - E (for Elohim, a generic name for God)
  - D (for Deuteronomic)
  - P (for Priestly)
- A newer version of the Documentary Theory is Wellhausen (late 1800s). Supported the JEDP theory based on an evolutionary basis.
  - For example, all religions develop first from animism (primitive religious beliefs from uneducated, indigenous people) to more sophisticated monotheism (belief in one God). This is part of the evolutionary process.
  - Beginning assumptions - Israel’s religion was merely man-made
  - Also made arguments that multiple god worship (more primitive forms) is contained in the OT but has been somewhat cleaned up.
- Support for Moses' Authorship
  - Pentateuch claims Moses wrote it
  - Other OT books point to Moses
  - NT affirms Moses wrote it
  - The author must have lived in Egypt
  - Remarkable unity of the arrangement
  - Moses had high education, background, etc.
  - Writing was widely prevalent in those days in Egypt
- Arguments for Source Division (multiple sources):
  - Uses of multiple names for God
  - distinctive words/phases in separate sections
  - Supposed Doublets (similar things) and Parallel Accounts
    - Examples are given in two accounts of the creation
    - Diverse flood narratives
    - Etc.
    - Note - Part of the reason is the style of Hebrew literary style
  - Rare Words - if words occur less than 3 or 4 times during that time then assume older text because not common to use those words
    - Note - We don’t have sufficient data
  - *Aramaism* - a word, phrase, idiom, or another characteristic of Aramaic occurring in a corpus (content) written in another language. These are found in the Hebrew text
  - Reference to other gods in OT - Arguments have been made quoting selective scriptures that there was an existing belief in gods
    - Note, all of the alleged texts are capable of far different interpretations that better fit with existing evidence.

## Archeological Evidence for the Pentateuch

- Allegation: Writing was unknown in Israel before King David
  - Found lots of examples contrary to this original opinion
- Allegation: Genesis accounts of the career of Abraham, etc, untrustworthy
  - Again items discovered that refuted the original claims
- Allegation: Priestly Code was too advanced for the time
  - Other cultures discovered to also have advanced codes

## Genesis

- Means “in the beginning”. Selective story of creation.
- According to tradition, Mose wrote the account
  - of oral and written traditions and provided info
- 7 days of creation (chapter 1)
  - literal 24-hour day
  - revelational day
  - geological day
- Christian Views of Creation
  - Historic Creationism: God created in the 1st verse existed for an undefined period. The creation of Adam and Eve occurred in six literal 24-hour days.
  - Young-earth Creationism: God created the entire universe in 6 literal days.
  - Day-age View: 6 sequential periods (geological).
  - Theistic Evolution: Began creation and then pulled back and used the natural process of evolution.
- Age of the Human Race
  - the prehistoric man from 200,000 to 500,00 years ago
  - Neanderthal origin 50,000 years ago
  - ~ 2000 years from Adam to Abraham, ~ 2000 years from Abraham to Christ. Thus, a total of **~ 6000 years** are accounted for in the Bible.
  - Races before Adam are not a part of the Adamic covenant -- maybe don’t have souls. Seems clear that in Gen 1:26 God is creating a different being when he made Adam. The first man was created in the spiritual image of God.
  - Note: Gen 1:1 can be viewed as the Earth is very old, but the creation of Adam (made in the image of God) started the 6k-10k year timetable.
- Charles Darwin's “Origin of Species” (1859)
  - explain origin by natural selection rather than by God’s design (survival of the fitness)
  - left no room for divine activity in the process of “creation”
  - wanted to overthrow the argument of God’s existence based on the evidence of design in nature
  - rejects the existence of a personal God
- Historical Notes
  - In the 18th century during the Age of Reason science gave an alternative worldview of creation.
  - Europe ultimately adopted liberal Christianity in the 19th century
  - Naturalism - the belief that all phenomena can be explained only in terms of natural causes and laws.
- Adam and the Fall
  - New Testament authors accepted the literal history of Adam
- Difficulties with Noah and the Flood
  - Lack of geologic evidence for a worldwide cataclysm .. given rise to doubts

## Books of Prophecy (17)
- Prophecy - foretelling the future, what God is going to do in the future
- Prophet - man of God, servant of the Lord, messenger of the Lord, speaker for God
- Moses was a prophet. Samuel started a school of prophets
- The early church had prophets, John being the last one (Revelations)
- Written during 3 main periods:
  - Pre-exilic - warning of God’s coming judgment
  - Exilic (70 years) - coming deliverance
  - Post-Exilic - coming of Christ

## Jewish Sacrifices
Reference article: http://www.gotquestions.org/Jewish-sacrifices.html

- For the most part, the Jewish practice of animal sacrifice to receive forgiveness stopped in the year `A.D. 70` when the **Roman army destroyed the Holy Temple in Jerusalem**, the place where sacrifices were offered.
- Essentially, Jews stopped offering sacrifices because they didn't have a proper place to offer them. The Torah (the Law of Moses) specifically commanded Israel not to offer sacrifices wherever they felt like it. They were only permitted to offer sacrifices in the one place that God has chosen for that purpose see [Deuteronomy 12:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2012%3A13-14&version=ESV).
- Today, modern Jews believe that forgiveness for sins is obtained through repentance, prayer, and good deeds. They use verses like the one found in `Hosea 6:6` which says, “For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.”
- But both the Old and New Testaments are very clear: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement” [(Leviticus 17:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+17%3A11&version=ESV)). And also, “All things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness” ([Hebrews 9:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9%3A22&version=ESV)).

## Ark of the Covenant
Reference articles - https://www.gotquestions.org/ark-of-the-covenant.html and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant).

- A chest described in Exodus containing Tablets of Stone for the 10 commandments
- Built by Moses through instructions from God; ~1 year after the exodus
- Placed in the tent called the Tabernacle
- At one point the Philistines capture the ark but give it back after 7 months
- Placed in the temple built by Solomon
- The Babylonian destroy Jerusalem and Solomon's temple. There is no record of what happened to the Ark
