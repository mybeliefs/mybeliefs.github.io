title: Why I believe
slug: /
---

*I decided to capture why I believe. I think understanding what motivates my beliefs is essential. This document captures in writing my **reasons for faith**. `6.18.2021.`*

Also captured are *my notes* on studying the Bible and other related topics.

## What

### Core
The following “list” is a set of core beliefs that I hold. These are the beliefs I can simply state when asked, versus a creed or a specific church doctrine.

- That people are inherently sinful. Right from birth. Thus, everyone needs justification, a Savior.
- That God came in flesh and died for our sins so that we could be justified in front of a holy God.
- God is both `Holy` and `Merciful` (full of grace).
- Jesus Christ was God in the flesh.
- Christ lived a sinless life for the ~ 33 years he was here.
- The resurrection was a miracle.
- That God is three persons - the Trinity
- I believe the Bible is without error for teaching and spiritual guidance ... `submit to its authority`

The [Apostles' Creed](https://www.gotquestions.org/apostles-creed.html):

> I believe in God, the Father Almighty,the Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:

> Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary,suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell.
The third day He arose again from the dead.He ascended into heaven
and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.

> I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting.
Amen.


### Bible
The following summarizes my view of the bible and its authority. These are my personal beliefs, versus a specific list from a book and/or an organization.

- Is God’s revealed purpose and story to us; his sons and daughters.
- Is a story about God and his relationship with fallen people.
- Is perfect in intent and teaching.
- Is authoritative over our behavior, thus we are in submission to it.
- You can not read a single verse, requires context.
- It is a *mistake* to think your `life experiences` <ins>answer the questions of what the bible is saying</ins>. Let the bible speak for itself.
- Is complex and requires serious study and research to fully understand.
- Is to be understood based on the time and culture of when it was written - context.
- Is copied by man over time, thus has copy errors.

### Pray
The following are my thoughts on praying, what to expect, and what the benefits are.

- Centers my thoughts and focus on God, rather than myself.
- Used to clearly communicate my thoughts and feeling toward God.
- Readjusts perspective about my current situation; God center vs me center.
- Used to ask God for my needs.
- Used to ask God for his [providence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_providence).
- I should not pray to ask God to provide all of my “earthly” wants. Rather I should pray based on His will. Understanding His will can be found in studying the Bible.
- Praying in Faith means praying in God’s will.

An excerpt from Sinclair Ferguson's article on the [Pray of Faith](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/prayer-faith):

> *“This, then, is the prayer of faith: to ask God to accomplish what He has promised in His Word. That promise is the only ground for our confidence in asking. Such confidence is not "worked up" from within our emotional life; rather, it is given and supported by what God has said in Scripture.”*


> *“This is why true prayer can never be divorced from real holiness. The prayer of faith can be made only by the "righteous" man whose life is being more and more aligned with the covenant grace and purposes of God.”*

### Not Sure
There are many areas of my faith that I am now sure about.

- For people who don’t hear the gospel, what happens to them?
- Is Hell a physical place and eternal for all unbelievers?
- Can people lose their faith?
- What heaven will be like?

## Evidence
What are the pieces of evidence for my Christian faith? What can I cite as “logical reasons” why I believe? Why is this not just a tale or an old story that has been passed on?

What does it take to believe something? Many complex things are not 100% proven, even though there is a consensus that they are true. There will always be an element of “faith” in our beliefs.

:::important
There will always be an element of “faith” in our beliefs.
:::

The following are some evidential items for me.

### Universe
A beginning. Even the *big bang* theory points to a specific starting point. How could **nothing** create the Commos? The complexity that we have in our galaxy to the intricacies contained in our eyes is overwhelming. For me, it is easier to believe in the *virgin birth of Christ*, whereas an atheist believes in the *virgin birth of the universe*.

- The **world exists**, which in itself is proof
- The **Fine-Tunning** argument. There is purpose and order in this world, indicating a **designer**. The mathematical probability of all factors working together to sustain this world is *1 in a trillion-trillion chance*.
  - [Dr. William Lane Craig's Talk on Fine Tunning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BId8kdBFHKM)
  - [Got Questions description of Fine Tuning](https://www.gotquestions.org/fine-tuning-argument.html)
- **Beauty and meaning**. Our response to *beauty*, *art*, and *love* tells us intuitively there is a purpose to this world. These are not just accidental occurrences.
- We all have natural **desires for eternity, justice, love, etc.**, don't these *point to something greater* than a random materialistic world?


### Experience
#### Personal
My personal experience. As a young teenager, I had a need. **I worried excessively. I had no peace**. So I was searching for something, something to take away the worry. This search opened me up to go to church with our housekeeper’s son. I had been brought up going to a Luthern church, but it had no impact on me. Something my mother made me do. I still remember being in a group of other kids and they were singing. It was different. Not long after attending this church, I decided to commit myself and live for Christ. I am not sure if I knew what that meant, but I decided to trust God. It was at a Saturday night church service and I was 15. **Everything changed after that evening**, and I have never looked back. The peace I was looking for, came immediately.

So I was motivated by a **need**, I was searching.

That initial experience sometimes is called being *born again*, which happened over 40 years ago. But my <u>current</u> experiences influence why I believe today. Meaning I still have a need - purpose, forgiveness, meaning beyond my current circumstances, and perspective on the ups and downs of life.

#### Nature
I believe that nature points to God. When experiencing the beauty of nature and all of its creation I am simply in awe. What about animals, the ocean, mountains, lakes, forests, and deserts? How about the birth of a child? The complexity of the body. There are so many unbelievable wonders in this world that **all point to a creator** when giving serious thought to the issue.

A scripture reference:

- Romans 1:20 - For since the creation of the world `God’s invisible qualities` — his eternal power and divine nature — `have been seen`, being understood from what has been made, so that people are **without excuse**.

#### Morality
Everyone and every culture understand morality - a standard by which people should live by independent of their convictions.

- Everyone has moral feelings, what is right and what is wrong.
- Where do human rights come from?

Without a belief in a higher power, there is no real justification for them.

#### Brokeness
There is a sense that the world does not work as intended - it is broken.

- Wars
- Sickness
- Disabilities
- Mental health issues
- Fractured relationships
- Guilt
- Addictions
- Death
- Etc.

We all long for more. How do we make sense of this? Where is our identity? Through relationships, accomplishments, pleasure?

We are continually disappointed. There has to be more.

For me, outside my belief in God, I have no hope.

### Resurrection
The **resurrection** of Christ is at the **core of Christianity**, as claimed in one of the *earliest creeds* in `1 Corinthians 15:3-7`.

> *3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. 6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.*

The apostle Paul also stated that if *"Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins"*.  [1 Corinthians 15:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1corinthians+15%3A17&version=NIV).

:::caution
"And if Christ has **not been raised**, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain" - [1 Corinthians 15:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A14&version=ESV) and "... we are of all people most to be **pitied**" - [1 Corinthians 15:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1corinthians+15%3A19&version=ESV).
:::


The resurrection is the reason for **my future hope**.

The following are some of the *basics* [^1] of why I believe the resurrection happened:

1. Jesus was crucified and died. This is not in dispute.
2. Jesus's disciples believed that he rose from the dead. All of the disciples were persecuted and [willing to die](https://www.gotquestions.org/apostles-die.html) for their faith. They knew for a fact if Jesus had risen or not. Liars are not martyrs.
3. Paul, an enemy of the church, converted based on [encountering the risen Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2022%3A6-11&version=ESV). Paul was persecuted and martyred. Tradition holds that he was [beheaded](https://www.gotquestions.org/how-did-Paul-die.html).
4. His half-brother James converts who was a skeptic. Jesus appears to him (1 Cor. 15) and he later becomes a leader of the church.
5. The empty tomb. The movement started in Jerusalem and authorities could have easily stopped the spread by simply showing the corpse.


### History


#### Christ's Influence on the Common Era
Jesus' life initiated the history timeline to be viewed into two separate eras - B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (Anno Domini - in the year of the Lord). No other person in our history has had this kind of influence.

The following is a list of some of the *items* [^2] of why I believe that Jesus influenced our Common Era more than anyone else in history:

- More **books** are written about Jesus than anyone else.
- **Art** was created by renowned masters, everywhere and in every period of time, more on Jesus than anyone else.
- Just like in art, **Music** has been dominated historically by Christians.
- **Schools** are a direct result of Christians meeting in communities of teachers and scholars. Christians founded most of the top fifty universities and have shaped every aspect of our education.
- Christ's followers believed they could better understand God by studying the *Book of Nature*. Contribution to the study of  **Science** by believers has been huge and continues to this day.
- and **Hospitals** are the results of Christian followers, who still provide the largest non-government healthcare services in the world.


### Note
I can't become an expert (i.e. scholar) on all of these topics. I read and consider what "other experts" claim. And I do have biases ... I want it to be true. Why? Because I am dependent on it. It is my life experience. I am happy and more at peace when I rely on a God that I can't physically see. So there will always be an element of faith required.

:::tip
There will always be an element of faith required. I am providing reasons to believe. Of course, I want them to be true. Again, based on my experience. But there are reasonable "reasons" not to believe. But I choose faith.
:::

But, I have experienced the real Christ. Otherwise, my experiences have been fake. And that has not been the case.


## Difficulties
There are many difficulties to faith, items that are not understand. I don't believe we can know everything. There will always be an element of faith, but the reasons for faith are strong, which enable me to be ok with things are concern me.

The following is a list of topics that I wrestle with. I provide some of my understanding of these items.
