title: Why I believe
slug: /
---

I have decided to allocate time, basically one early morning session per week, to capture *“why I believe”*. I think understanding what motivates my beliefs is essential. I don’t believe because other people believe, or because I was brought up believing. This document will be used to capture my **reasons for faith**. I am not sure how long this will take, maybe a few years, maybe more with multiple updates and iterations. `6.18.2021`.

## What

### Core
The following “list” is a set of core beliefs that I hold. These are the beliefs I can simply state when asked, versus a creed or a specific church doctrine. 

- That people are inherently sinful. Right from birth. Thus, everyone needs justification, a Savior.
- That God came in flesh and died for our sins so that we could be justified in front of a holy God. 
- God is both `Holy` and `Merciful` (full of grace). 
- Jesus Christ was God in the flesh.
- Christ lived a sinless life for the ~ 33 years he was here.
- The resurrection was a miracle. 
- That God is three persons - the Trinity
- I believe the Bible is without error for teaching and spiritual guidance.  

### Bible
The following summarizes my view of the bible and its authority. These are my personal beliefs, versus a specific list from a book and/or an organization. 

- Is God’s revealed purpose and story to us; his sons and daughters.
- Is a story about God and his relationship with fallen people. 
- Is perfect in intent and teaching.
- Is authoritative over our behavior, thus we are in submission to it.
- You can not read a single verse, requires context.
- It is a *mistake* to think your `life experiences` <ins>answer the questions of what the bible is saying</ins>. Let the bible speak for itself. 
- Is complex and requires serious study and research to fully understand. 
- Is to be understood based on the time and culture of when it was written - context.
- Is copied by man over time, thus has copy errors.

### Pray
The following are my thoughts on praying, what to expect, and what the benefits are. 

- Centers my thoughts and focus on God, rather than myself. 
- Used to clearly communicate my thoughts and feeling toward God.
- Readjusts perspective about my current situation; God center vs me center.
- Used to ask God for my needs.
- Used to ask God for his [providence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_providence).
- I should not pray to ask God to provide all of my “earthly” wants. Rather I should pray based on His will. Understanding His will can be found in studying the Bible.  
- Praying in Faith means praying in God’s will. 

An excerpt from Sinclair Ferguson's article on the [Pray of Faith](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/prayer-faith):

> *“This, then, is the prayer of faith: to ask God to accomplish what He has promised in His Word. That promise is the only ground for our confidence in asking. Such confidence is not "worked up" from within our emotional life; rather, it is given and supported by what God has said in Scripture.”* 


> *“This is why true prayer can never be divorced from real holiness. The prayer of faith can be made only by the "righteous" man whose life is being more and more aligned with the covenant grace and purposes of God.”*

### Not Sure
There are many areas of my faith that I am now sure about. 

- For people who don’t hear the gospel, what happens to them?
- Is Hell a physical place and eternal for all unbelievers?
- Can people lose their faith?
- What heaven be like?  

## Experience
### Emotions
My personal experience. As a young teenager, I had a need. **I worried excessively. I had no peace**. So I was searching for something, something to take away the worry. This search opened me up to go to church with our housekeeper’s son. I had been brought up going to a Luthern church, but it had no impact on me. Something my mother made me do. I still remember being in a group of other kids and they were singing. It was different. Not long after attending this church, I decided to commit myself and live for Christ. I am not sure if I knew what that meant, but I decided to trust God. It was at a Saturday night church service and I was 15. **Everything changed after that evening**, and I have never looked back. The peace I was looking for, came immediately. 

So I was motivated by a **need**, I was searching. 

That initial experience sometimes is called being born again, which happened over 40 years ago. But my current experiences still greatly influence why I believe today. Meaning I still have a need - purpose, forgiveness, meaning beyond my current circumstances, and perspective on the ups and downs of life. 

### Nature
Why I believe that nature points to God. A scripture reference:

- Romans 1:20 - For since the creation of the world `God’s invisible qualities` — his eternal power and divine nature — `have been seen`, being understood from what has been made, so that people are **without excuse**.

When experiencing the beauty of nature and all of its creation I am simply in awe. What about animals and ocean creatures, mountains, lakes, forests, deserts. How about the birth of a child. The complexity of the body. There are so many unbelievable wonders in this world that all point to a creator when given a serious thought.
