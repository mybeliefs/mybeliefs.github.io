title: Why I believe
slug: /
---

*I decided to capture why I believe. I think understanding what motivates my beliefs is essential. This document captures in writing my **reasons for faith**. `6.18.2021.`*

Also captured are *my notes* on studying the Bible and other related topics.

## What

### Core
The following “list” is a set of core beliefs that I hold. These are the beliefs I can simply state when asked, versus a creed or a specific church doctrine.

- That people are inherently sinful. Right from birth. Thus, everyone needs justification, a Savior.
- That God came in flesh and died for our sins so that we could be justified in front of a holy God.
- God is both `Holy` and `Merciful` (full of grace).
- Jesus Christ was God in the flesh.
- Christ lived a sinless life for the ~ 33 years he was here.
- The resurrection was a miracle.
- That God is three persons - the Trinity
- I believe the Bible is without error for teaching and spiritual guidance ... `submit to its authority`

The [Apostles' Creed](https://www.gotquestions.org/apostles-creed.html):

> I believe in God, the Father Almighty,the Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:

> Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary,suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell.
The third day He arose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven
and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.

> I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting.
Amen.


### Bible
The following summarizes my view of the bible and its authority. These are my personal beliefs, versus a specific list from a book and/or an organization.

- Is God’s revealed purpose and story to us; his sons and daughters.
- Is a story about God and his relationship with fallen people.
- Is perfect in intent and teaching.
- Is authoritative over our behavior, thus we are in submission to it.
- You can not read a single verse, requires context.
- It is a *mistake* to think your `life experiences` <ins>answer the questions of what the bible is saying</ins>. Let the bible speak for itself.
- Is complex and requires serious study and research to fully understand.
- Is to be understood based on the time and culture of when it was written - context.
- Is copied by man over time, thus has copy errors.

### Pray
The following are my thoughts on praying, what to expect, and what the benefits are.

- Centers my thoughts and focus on God, rather than myself.
- Used to clearly communicate my thoughts and feeling toward God.
- Readjusts perspective about my current situation; God center vs me center.
- Used to ask God for my needs.
- Used to ask God for his [providence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_providence).
- I should not pray to ask God to provide all of my “earthly” wants. Rather I should pray based on His will. Understanding His will can be found in studying the Bible.
- Praying in Faith means praying in God’s will.

An excerpt from Sinclair Ferguson's article on the [Pray of Faith](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/prayer-faith):

> *“This, then, is the prayer of faith: to ask God to accomplish what He has promised in His Word. That promise is the only ground for our confidence in asking. Such confidence is not "worked up" from within our emotional life; rather, it is given and supported by what God has said in Scripture.”*


> *“This is why true prayer can never be divorced from real holiness. The prayer of faith can be made only by the "righteous" man whose life is being more and more aligned with the covenant grace and purposes of God.”*

### Not Sure
There are many areas of my faith that I am now sure about.

- For people who don’t hear the gospel, what happens to them? Only God knows, and we trust in His perfect righteousness that goes beyond our comprehension. Remember the people of the Old Testament did not know of Jesus or the Bible.
- What is separation from God ... Hell? Is it a physical place?
- Can people lose their faith?
- What heaven will be like?

## Evidence
What are the pieces of evidence for my Christian faith? What can I cite as “logical reasons” why I believe? Why is this not just a tale or an old story that has been passed on?

What does it take to believe something? Many complex things are not 100% proven, even though there is a consensus that they are true. There will always be an element of “faith” in our beliefs.

:::important
There will always be an element of “faith” in our beliefs.
:::

The following are some evidential items for me.

### Universe
A beginning. Even the *big bang* theory points to a specific starting point. How could **nothing** create the Commos? The complexity that we have in our galaxy to the intricacies contained in our eyes is overwhelming. For me, it is easier to believe in the *virgin birth of Christ*, whereas an atheist believes in the *virgin birth of the universe*.

- The **world exists**, which in itself is proof
- The **Fine-Tunning** argument. There is purpose and order in this world, indicating a **designer**. The mathematical probability of all factors working together to sustain this world is *1 in a trillion-trillion chance*.
  - [Dr. William Lane Craig's Talk on Fine Tunning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BId8kdBFHKM)
  - [Got Questions description of Fine Tuning](https://www.gotquestions.org/fine-tuning-argument.html)
- **Beauty and meaning**. Our response to *beauty*, *art*, and *love* tells us intuitively there is a purpose to this world. These are not just accidental occurrences.
- We all have natural **desires for eternity, justice, love, etc.**, don't these *point to something greater* than a random materialistic world?


### Experience
#### Personal
My personal experience. As a young teenager, I had a need. **I worried excessively. I had no peace**. So I was searching for something, something to take away the worry. This search opened me up to go to church with our housekeeper’s son. I had been brought up going to a Luthern church, but it had no impact on me. Something my mother made me do. I still remember being in a group of other kids and they were singing. It was different. Not long after attending this church, I decided to commit myself and live for Christ. I am not sure if I knew what that meant, but I decided to trust God. It was at a Saturday night church service and I was 15. **Everything changed after that evening**, and I have never looked back. The peace I was looking for, came immediately.

So I was motivated by a **need**, I was searching.

That initial experience sometimes is called being *born again*, which happened over 40 years ago. But my <u>current</u> experiences influence why I believe today. Meaning I still have a need - purpose, forgiveness, meaning beyond my current circumstances, and perspective on the ups and downs of life.

#### Nature
I believe that nature points to God. When experiencing the beauty of nature and all of its creation I am simply in awe. What about animals, the ocean, mountains, lakes, forests, and deserts? How about the birth of a child? The complexity of the body. There are so many unbelievable wonders in this world that **all point to a creator** when giving serious thought to the issue.

A scripture reference:

- Romans 1:20 - For since the creation of the world `God’s invisible qualities` — his eternal power and divine nature — `have been seen`, being understood from what has been made, so that people are **without excuse**.

#### Morality
Everyone and every culture understand morality - a standard by which people should live by independent of their convictions.

- Everyone has moral feelings, what is right and what is wrong.
- Where do human rights come from?

Without a belief in a higher power, there is no real justification for them.

#### Brokeness
There is a sense that the world does not work as intended - it is broken.

- Wars
- Sickness
- Disabilities
- Mental health issues
- Fractured relationships
- Guilt
- Addictions
- Death
- Etc.

We all long for more. How do we make sense of this? Where is our identity? Through relationships, accomplishments, pleasure?

We are continually disappointed. There has to be more.

For me, outside my belief in God, I have no hope.

### Resurrection
The **resurrection** of Christ is at the **core of Christianity**, as claimed in one of the *earliest creeds* in `1 Corinthians 15:3-7`.

> *3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. 6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.*

The apostle Paul also stated that if *"Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins"*.  [1 Corinthians 15:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1corinthians+15%3A17&version=NIV).

:::caution
"And if Christ has **not been raised**, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain" - [1 Corinthians 15:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A14&version=ESV) and "... we are of all people most to be **pitied**" - [1 Corinthians 15:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1corinthians+15%3A19&version=ESV).
:::


The resurrection is the reason for **my future hope**.

The following are some of the *basics* [^1] of why I believe the resurrection happened:

1. Jesus was crucified and died. This is not in dispute.
2. Jesus's disciples believed that he rose from the dead. All of the disciples were persecuted and [willing to die](https://www.gotquestions.org/apostles-die.html) for their faith. They knew for a fact if Jesus had risen or not. Liars are not martyrs.
3. Paul, an enemy of the church, converted based on [encountering the risen Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2022%3A6-11&version=ESV). Paul was persecuted and martyred. Tradition holds that he was [beheaded](https://www.gotquestions.org/how-did-Paul-die.html).
4. His half-brother James converts who was a skeptic. Jesus appears to him (1 Cor. 15) and he later becomes a leader of the church.
5. The empty tomb. The movement started in Jerusalem and authorities could have easily stopped the spread by simply showing the corpse.

### History

#### Christ's Influence on the Common Era
Jesus' life initiated the history timeline to be viewed into two separate eras - B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (Anno Domini - in the year of the Lord). No other person in our history has had this kind of influence.

The following is a list of some of the *items* [^2] of why I believe that Jesus influenced our Common Era more than anyone else in history:

- More **books** are written about Jesus than anyone else.
- **Art** was created by renowned masters, everywhere and in every period of time, more on Jesus than anyone else.
- Just like in art, **Music** has been dominated historically by Christians.
- **Schools** are a direct result of Christians meeting in communities of teachers and scholars. Christians founded most of the top fifty universities and have shaped every aspect of our education.
- Christ's followers believed they could better understand God by studying the *Book of Nature*. Contribution to the study of  **Science** by believers has been huge and continues to this day.
- and **Hospitals** are the results of Christian followers, who still provide the largest non-government healthcare services in the world.


### Note
I can't become an expert (i.e. scholar) on all of these topics. I read and consider what "other experts" claim. And I do have biases ... I want it to be true. Why? Because I am dependent on it. It is my life experience. I am happy and more at peace when I rely on a God that I can't physically see. So there will always be an element of faith required.

But, I have experienced the real Christ. Otherwise, my experiences have been fake. And that has not been the case.

:::tip
There will always be an element of faith required. I am providing reasons to believe. Of course, I want them to be true. Again, based on my experience. But I understand why some people are skeptics. But I choose faith.
:::


## Difficulties
There are many difficulties to faith, items that are not well understood. I don't believe we can know everything. There will always be an element of faith, but the reasons for faith are strong, which enable me to be ok with things that can be challenging.

The following is a list of topics that I wrestle with. I provide some of my understanding of these items.

### Other Religions
How can Christianity claim to be the only true religion? What about Jews and Muslims? There are three monotheistic religions that all claim to be exclusive and universal ... *there is only one true God who created the universe.*

The central theme for Christians is that Christ rose from the grave. Jews and Muslims do **not** believe this. Muslims believe that Jesus was taken directly to heaven and was not divine. Jews and Atheists hold that Jesus stayed in the grave.

There is only one objective truth, regardless if we believe it or not.

:::caution
There is only one objective truth, regardless if we believe it or not.
:::

Jesus claimed to be the only path to God. `John 14:6` - Jesus said to him, *“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."* Jesus claimed to be God and the only way to truth.

This is either true or not. I choose to believe it. It does not make sense to me that each person can have their own truth or that God has revealed himself also in other religions.

### Religious Violence
Jesus completely changed how we *are to treat others*, including our enemies.

:::info
"But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." - [Matthew 5:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A39&version=ESV)

"But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you," - [Matthew 5:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A44&version=ESV).
:::

But there is history that can be difficult to reconcile.

#### Christian Crusades
The crusades took place from 1095 to 1230, started officially by the Latin Church (Pope Urban II). Its purpose was to "reclaim"  Holy Land that have been conquered by Muslims.

> The crusades were terrible. Many people were forced to convert to Christianity. They were unbiblical. [^3]

Without question, there have been acts of violence by Christian-labeled groups (Northern Ireland Catholics vs Protestants, Rwandan genocide in 1994, etc.). But the ethical standards by which we judge these events are given to us by Christianity. [^4]


#### Old Testament
The Old Testament contains instructions to destroy the Canaanities and other surrounding nations. Numerous verses are instructing the "destruction" of groups:

- ... the land that you are entering to take possession of it, ..., then you must devote them to complete destruction ... [Deuteronomy 7:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+7%3A1-2&version=ESV)
- ... shall devote them to complete destruction, ... that they may not teach you to do according to all their adominable practices ... - [Deuteronomy 20:16-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+20%3A17-18&version=ESV)
- ... Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey. [1 Samuel 15:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+15%3A1-3&version=ESV)
- Etc.

For me, someone from the 21 century and a westerner, these verses can be difficult to understand. Certainly taken out of context they can be disturbing. Understanding an ancient document, its writing style, culture, etc., takes time and effort.

A few thoughts on this challenging topic:

- In the bigger picture, God is using the Israelites to bring about His salvation. The battles of the book of Joshua, for example, were a part of God’s plan to cleanse the land of evil practices that had enslaved the people of Canaan. The Bible is telling us about God’s mission to restore his rebellious creation and bring all of humanity back to himself. This story continues with the New Testament of Christ's triumphed over death, through the violence of the cross.[^5]
- Total dismantling of the Canaanite civilzation was necessary to protect Israel against becoming corrupted. This is a critical time in history, judgement is on the land, and God's plans to save the whole world are being enacted.[^6]
- God is gracious and merciful, He is also a God of holiness and wrath. [^7]
- The God of the new testament shows similar characteristics. In [Acts 5:4-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5%3A4-10&version=ESV), the couple suddenly dies when withholding their proceeds from selling property. The book of Revelations has lots of destruction in it. *The God of the Old and New Testament should be feared, while at the same time is all-loving.*
- God had morally sufficient reasons for His judgement on Canaan, and Israel was merely the instrument of His justice. Later God uses the nations of Assyria and Babylon to judge Israel. [^8]

:::tip
If I truly believe that God is the giver of life, then it is His to take away.
:::

#### Humans Do Bad Things
Humans, whether associated with organized religion or not, have always done very bad things. And I believe this will continue. Marxism, which is anti-religious, led to millions of atrocious. Communism's purpose was to remove religion and enable justice for its people. But its history indicates that 61 million people were killed in the former Soviet Union and 35 million in the People's Republic of China.

:::warning
Religious violence is a **fallen** human problem.
:::

### Suffering
The question people struggle with is if God is good and all-powerful, why does "pointless suffering and evil" exist? He must not be good and all-powerful, or does not even exists? If God **does not exist**, then *suffering* is just a part of our natural evolution. There is no justice and suffering has no purpose.  It is all part of natural selection.

:::tip
The *biblical framework* for suffering is about our relationship with God, and *finding Him in our suffering*. The God of the Bible is <u>not</u> about a higher power answering all of our requests for **pleasure** and **comfort** (i.e. vending machine), it is about itimately knowing Him.
:::

Some thoughts and observations on suffering:

- With time and perspective often "some" of our suffering turns out to have benefits that we would have never experienced otherwise.
- Christianity provides hope for the future. The Bible promises one day all things will be restored ... made right.
- We will better understand the purpose someday, but in the context of eternity, suffering will be a pleasant reminder of our past that has been restored.
- *"Just because you can't see or imagine a good reason why God might allow something to happend doesn't mean there can't be one".* [^9]
- God came down as a human and also suffered and experienced death by being crucified. *"We still do not know what the answer is. However, we know know what the answer isn't. It can't be that he doesn't love us".* [^9]
- *"Suffering which appears to be pointless within our limited framework may be seen to be justly permitted within God's wider framework.  Every event that occurs sends a ripple effect through history such that God's morally sufficient reason for permitting it might not emerge until centuries from now, maybe in another land. Only an all-knowing God can grasp the complexities of directing a world of free people toward his envisioned goals. The Christian faith entails doctrines that increase the probability of the co-existence of God and evil"*. [^10]
  - The chief purpose of life is <u>not happiness</u>, but the knowledge of God.
  - Mankind is in a state of <u>rebellion against God</u> and his purpose. The terrible human evils in the world are simply testimony to man's depravity in this state of spiritual alienation from God.
  - In the Christian view, this life is <u>not all there is</u>.
  - The sufferings of this life cannot even be compared to the <u>knowledge of God</u>.
  - Jesus also endured a suffering beyond all comprehension. He <u>bore the punishment for the sins of the entire world</u>. None of us can comprehend that suffering.


### Hell
How do we reconcile a loving God sending people to hell for internal punishment? There are a lot of "theories" about hell. The only thing I know about hell is that it is the separation from God's presence and grace. It is giving people what they want - control of their own lives.

:::warning
Hell is giving people what they want - separation from God's presence and grace.
:::

- The Bible teaches extensively on hell. [^11]
- The Bible teaches that heaven and hell are actual realities, but also indicates that all language about them is allusive, metaphorical, and partial. [^12]
- Hell is a choice people make to control their so-called "freedom from God". It is not like they are in a pit and want out, and they are sorry about everything. This is a caricature. Rather people will not give up control to be in the presence of God.  It is "<u>there will be done</u>".
- The language used is <u>not</u> literal but indicates separation from God. This is worse. We were created for worshipping the true God. Now everyone experiences "common grace", but when this is gone it becomes hell. "Hell is simply one's freely chosen path going on forever." [^13]


:::info
Whatever **hell** is, we will be in total agreement about who and why people are there. These are the people who wanted their separation from God.
:::

### Weird Scriptures
There are many Bible verses when read out of context can be confusing and evening disturbing. Here are few examples:

- *"But anything in the seas or the rivers that does not have fins and scales, ..., in the waters, is detestable to you."* - Leviticus 11:10 (ESV)
- *"If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives."* - Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (NIV)
- *"... Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."* - Exodus 23:19 (NIV)


When we read scriptures, we have to remember it was written at a different time and for a specific culture. It requires understanding the context and purpose of the Biblical authors. The Bible is a collection of books capturing the story of God redeeming his people.

- Includes *69 books* written in *3 languages* over *1500 years*.
- Composed of different genres such as *history*, *law*, *poetry*, *wisdom*, *prophecy*, and *apocalyptic literature*.
- Most of the "weird" verses we are see are not being understood in the proper context. [^14]

The Bible is both simple and very complex.  It is easy to cherry-pick verses out of context to make statements that are not applicable.

:::tip
Cherry-picking weird verses out of context can give us trouble. What is required is studying the context and doing background research. Doing this will require time and effort. Also, note there is most likely a long history of perspective on these tricky verses.
:::
