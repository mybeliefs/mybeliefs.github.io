## Topics

### Trinity
- https://www.gotquestions.org/Trinity-Bible.html

  > "The doctrine of the Trinity has been a divisive issue throughout the entire history of the Christian church. While the core aspects of the Trinity are clearly presented in God’s Word, some of the side issues are not as explicitly clear. The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God—but there is only one God. That is the biblical doctrine of the Trinity. Beyond that, the issues are, to a certain extent, debatable and non-essential."

### Dispensationalism

- Known for its distinctive [eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) (s.ca.tall.la.g) doctrines.
- Originated in the 19th century in the teachings of John Darby. The Scofield's Bible (1909) also contributed with its study notes.
- Up holds the doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture of the church.
  - Church raptured, taken to heaven before the second coming.
  - Will be a seven-year period of tribulation
  - The second coming is at the end of the tribulation.
  - There will be 1,000 years called the Millennial Kingdom.
- Holds that there are two distinct people of God - **Israel** and the **Church**.

> Note that Reform "covenant" theology holds that there is one people of God.
