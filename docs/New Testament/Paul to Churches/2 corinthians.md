## Overview

- Heard that his first letter had not completely accomplished its purpose. A group of men had come to Corinth and presented themselves as apostles. They were challenging Paul’s personal integrity/authority. 
- Paul wrote this letter; about a year after 1 Cor. Another letter was written .. “severe” to address the situation. 2nd Cor. was written after this. Note, there was most likely a letter even before 1 Cor. - a total of 4 letters. 
- Most likely a “severe” letter did have some good results. Though there is a harsh tone also in chapters 10-13.
- The most emotional/personal of all of Paul’s letters

- Problems in this life are temporary when viewed in light of eternity. `4:17` - momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. 
- We are made new `5:17`, sinless because of Christ became our sin 5:21. Thus we can be confident approaching God & thankful
- All of our thoughts should be aligned with God (in the open) `10:5`
- God’s power is what we need in our weakness, we become strong in Him when we are weak `12:9-10`
