### Difficulties

- 11:5 Female head covering 
  - [head covering and does it apply to us today](https://bible.org/article/what-head-covering-1-cor-112-16-and-does-it-apply-us-today)
- 14:1-33 Issues concerning tongues (Msg versions pretty good)
- 14:34 Women should remain silent in the churches 
- 15:29 ..who are baptized for the dead? 

## Observations
- Faith comes from the power of God, not man’s wisdom 1:25
- The wisdom (perspective) we get comes <ins>from the Spirit</ins>. The unconverted person does not / cannot understand this view .. it comes from the Spirit (chapter 2). The message of the cross is foolishness to unbelievers (1:18)
- It is my business to judge inside the church .. don’t associate with believers that blatantly sin (5:8-13)
- It is God who makes a Church grow. The leaders are simply workers (planters) used by God. Thus, we should not over glorify (celebrity) the Leaders. This is a sign of an immature church (chapter 3).
- Don’t make others stumble with our freedom (chapter 8)
    - 10:23-32 for the glory of God, <ins>benefiting others</ins>
- We all have different roles used to build up the church 12:12
- Love is a set of actions (chapter 13)


## Chapters (16)

### Ch 1
> No Divisions, God’s wisdom not the world’s

- 8 ... guiltless in the day of our Lord 
- 10 no divisions among you, united in the same mind

- 31 Our only boast is in the Lord

### Ch 2
> Wisdom from the Spirit

- 4 Speech and message not in words of wisdom so could be demonstrated by the Spirit *{people from Corinth were fixated on wisdom}*. 5 <ins>Faith</ins> does not rest on the wisdom of men but in the <ins>power of God</ins>
God has revealed himself to us by his Spirit
- 12 The Spirit helps us understand what God has given us
- 13 Without the Spirit man does not accept the things of God ... they are <ins>foolishness</ins> to him. He can not understand them for they are spiritually discerned. 
- 16 We have the mind of Christ


### Ch 3
> Immature Church

    - 3 jealousy and quarreling among them
    - 4 “I follow Paul” or “I follow Apollos”
