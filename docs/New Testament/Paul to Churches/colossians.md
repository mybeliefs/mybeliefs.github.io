- [Introduction to Colossians](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-colossians/)

## Overview

- Paul wrote this letter during 1st imprisonment in Rome (all prison letters were written then). Prison letters (4): Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon 
- A mixture of an extreme form of Judaism and early Gnosticism (ancient religions that taught to shun the physical world, ruled by a lesser divinity)
- Thus Christ is completely adequate

### Bible Project
TBD

### Purpose
- Was to refute the Colossian's heresy: 
    - strict rules
    - angle worship
    - secret knowledge
    - reliance on human wisdom and knowledge

### Outline (4 chapters)
1. Who Christ is, but now we are holy and blameless
2. Not taken captive of a deceptive philosophy, made alive in Christ 
3. Put away old self, put on a new self 
4. Wisdom toward outsiders, speech always be gracious 


### Difficulties
None.

## Observations
- *Christ is everything*. The invisible God. All things were created by Him. Through Him, all things are reconciled. 
- We can not be *deceived by beliefs*, philosophies, etc. that take away from Christ being our savior. Everything is complete in Him. We don’t need to do weird things or believe in complicated theories. It is the <ins>cross</ins> that made us right
- We need to pursue righteousness, flee lust, greed, etc. Also, get rid of anger, rage, slander, etc. but rather show kindness, humility, patience, etc.   
- Always be gracious to non-believers, being wise in answering any questions
