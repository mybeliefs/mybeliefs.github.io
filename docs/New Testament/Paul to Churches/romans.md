- [Introduction to Romans](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-romans/)

## Overview

- Paul wrote this letter ~ A.D. 57
- Most likely on his 3rd missionary trip while at Corinth
- Written to the people at a church in Rome .. mostly Gentiles but there were lots of Jews
- Was not personally connected (had not met them) to the church, thus the content was not specific to their problems 
- Had not visited the church .. was providing a theological overview
- Reads like a theological essay versus a letter to a church


### Bible Project
TBD

### Doctrine of Election

- https://www.gotquestions.org/doctrine-of-election.html


#### Everything that happens is under God’s control
- “.. all things God works for the good of those who love him” Rom 8:28
- “works out everything in conformity with purpose of his will” Eph 1:11
- Little things: “.. every decision is from the Lord” Prov 16:33
- “.. [sparrow] will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father” Matt 10:29
- “.. intended to harm me, but God intended it for good ..” Gen 50:20
  
#### All Choices are free acts for which we are responsible 
- God works out his will perfectly through our willing actions 

#### We choose God because <ins>He</ins> has opened our hearts; people to choose God because <ins>they</ins> closed their hearts
- “There is no one .. who seeks God” Rom 3:11
- “The sinful mind is hostile to God” Rom 8:7
- “.. in order that God’s purpose in election might stand: .. Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated” Rom 9:10-13
- Our minds do not submit to God, they can not unless God steps in
- “.. Why did you make me like this? Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?” Rom 19:21
#### Two views
- Hyper-Calvinism - God determines
- Pelagianism - We prepare ourselves 
#### Romans 9:21-24 does not take either view. 
- the “prepared for condemnation” is not his doing (freely chosen sin)
- “whom he prepared in advance for glory” (God selected us)
- Considered a mystery, but what scripture teaches 
#### Other places in Scripture (beyond Paul’s writings)
- John 6:36-39 “..shall lose none of all that he has given me..”
- John 6:44 “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him..”
- John 10:25 “.. My sheep listen to my voice, .. and they follow me”
- 1 Peter 1:1-2: “To God’s elect .. who have been chosen ..”
- Acts 16:13-14 “..The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message”
#### Logic
- If we reject “election” and decide it is “free will” then the person who hears and believes, versus the one who does not, is more open, humbler, better insight, etc. It goes back to them being better
- We believe because we are called. 
- The doctrine of election preserves the doctrine of justification 
- We are our own would never want God, incapable of choosing him
- We don’t know why does not choose everyone .. it is a mystery 
- It is still fair to recuse some, he owes nothing to any of us
- We pray and share the gospel because the privilege of sharing in God’s work with him. Like a young child helping his father, the father does not really need the help but because of their relationship the father loves the child helping.
- Also we never try to guess who is elected .. who we pray for might be the next person God elects 
- Believers are chosen people, not choice people
- He loves us because He loves us!


### Purpose
- The basic gospel .. God’s plan of salvation for all mankind 
- Prepare for his coming visit
- The basic system of salvation
- Explains the relationship between Jew and Gentile in God’s overall plan


### Outline (28 chapters)
- 1-8     Being made righteous .. justification by faith (theology focused) 
- 9-11   Salvation 
- 12-16 Living righteous (practical focused)

### Difficulties
- **QUESTION(S) Ch 8**: The law brings on death. But the Spirits us free from the law, death. We are to live by the Spirit because the law did not change us, but rather just revealed our sins. It was powerless. But we do not live according to our sinful nature but by the Spirit `v4`.  Also, we are controlled by the Spirit of God who lives in us `v9`.  We have no obligation to live to our sinful nature `v12`. If we live according to it you will die `v13`. **But living by the Spirit you put to death the misdeed of your sinful nature `v13`**. So what does this look like in our life? We can always pray for forgiveness, but we are newly empowered to live differently .. not sinning as much? Where living by the law did not change our behavior. I know that we are made righteous because of God’s “sin offering”, but what about our behaviour? Should it be dramatically different? Sometimes I don’t feel that different. 
  - *{PRAY - Lord help me understand how You make it right for me. You justify me. You make all things work for my good - to shape me to be more like you. You have made a plan for me. You have already taken care of the future for me. Help me to understand and realize this. That I would NOT be afraid in life. That I would have joy now. And because of this I would be changed on the inside, motivated and enabled to live according to your purposes.}*


## Observations
- Romans is about the gospel -- good news on what has been done!
- Obedience comes through faith (v1:5) -- a result of faith, not a condition 
- Paul is commissioned to bring the gospel to Gentiles. We also are commissioned to go to all nations making disciples... 
- Without judgment, salvation has no meaning!
- Saved by believing that God can only justify us
- There is nothing to boast about .. nothing
- God is evident to people, but they choose to ignore Him. He then gives them over to their evil desires
- No one is righteous
- Righteousness comes through faith in Christ
- In `v1:16` Paul states is not ashamed of the Gospel .. it provides the power to change, see things differently, and be forgiven and reconciled to God. Why then am I sometimes hesitant to share? Am I afraid of what others might think? Do I not really feel it is good news? 
- Offer ourselves as instruments of righteousness
- A mind-controlled by Spirit is life and peace
- *`If you confess with your mouth, that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him, you will be saved .. both Jews and Gentiles.`*
- Do not be conformed to this world. We need to be transformed .. different. To take on Godly character (sharing, living in harmony, hating evil, etc.)
- We are told to love our neighbor as yourself 
- Neve take liberty to something that could make another brother/sister in Christ stumble. Even though it is OK with us. Need to be concerned about others, not our own desires.
- Life is not about just eating and drinking, but rather having joy in the Spirit


## Chapters (16)

### Ch 1
> choose to ignore God

- Paul is set apart for the gospel of God
- Scriptures (OT) promised a Son. His identity was confirmed when raised from the dead.
- Paul is looking forward to seeing them in person
- The Church is known around the world about its “faith” 
- Paul wants to visit to be “mutually encouraged” by the visit (v12)
- The gospel is the **power of God** (v16). It brings salvation to us. {It changes lives, changes our perspective, how we live, it reconciles us to God}
- Righteousness that is from faith. We have been given righteousness by believing .. ongoing (v17)
- The **Wrath of God** is being revealed {how is this wrath being revealed? By allowing them to reach their desires, their idols, the things they worship}
- God has made it “plain to them” {whoever created all of this must be unimaginable greate}
    - God’s invisible qualities have been clearly seen
    - men are without excuse
- They knew God but **choose to ignore him** {choose other “things” to worship; instead of the Creator we worship what was “created”}
    - God gave them over to sinful desires .. unnatural relationships
    - Became filled with every kind of wickedness .. envy, murder, strife, etc.
    - Not only continue doing these things but approve others of doing the same

### Ch 2
> circumcision of the heart

- Judging others and doing the same thing .. this won’t escape from God {chap 1 list of “wickedness” was focused on attitude. Similar to the Sermon on the Mount. Thus, this applies to religious people also}.
- (v6-8) God will give to each person according to what he has done {quoting Psalm 62 - their rest is in God.  Persisting in doing good is evidence of faith. Works do not save us, but if we have no works do we really have faith that changed us?}
    - doing good, etc., eternal life
    - reject the truth, etc, .. wrath and anger 
- The requirements of the law are written in our hearts
- A man is a Jew if he is one inwardly .. circumcision of the heart {a “religious” person loves the concepts of truth but is never changed by them. When you rely on spiritual achievements you look down on others -- who are we, we all break the law, look at our hearts -- motives, etc.}
- Historical Notes:
    - In ancient times you did not sign something but acted out a curse if you broke a covenant
    - Circumcision was the act of cutting something off. If the Jews broke the covenant they would be “cut off” from God
    - Jesus was “cut off” for us when he died and was separated from God for 3 days -- circumcised. In Him, we were circumcised


### Ch 3
> No one righteous, through faith we are righteous

- **There is no one righteous, not even one; all have turned away** `(v10)` *{both religious and irreligious people. No one, we are all in the same boat .. those who pursue morality and those who indulge in sensuality, etc.}*
    - “There is no fear of God before their eyes”
- We don’t even seek God (v11). *{Even our pursuit of God is to get what we want .. what He can give us}*
- No one does good, not even one (v12). *{A good deed is done for God’s glory, not ours. We should repent of our sin involving good works with the wrong motive}*
- No fear of God (v18) *{Inner awe of respect, trembling joy before the greatness of God}*
- The law makes us aware of our sin (v19) *{my response .. I am a sinner}*
- Righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe (v22). {This “righteousness” qualifies us .. acceptable .. to be a son of God. It is not dependent on us but on Christ. This method is totally unique to every other religion in the world}.
- `3:22-24` This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
- *{Saving faith is in “Jesus Christ and him crucified” 1 Cor. 2:2}*
- **Observation**
  - *A man of faith, totally relying on Christ’s saving act, does not think about his past or his future .. it is not about him. Just relies on Christ. He fixes our past and there is nothing we can do in the future that will justify us. Just accept and enjoy the gift. Now out of a response -- being thankful for such underserved grace -- we should be more like Christ in word and action.*
- Christ dying on the cross demonstrates God’s character -- requiring rules (standards) and consequences for breaking them `v25` 
- So how can anyone boast? `v27` *{faith understands that there is nothing we do that justifies us. God looks at me and sees his beautiful child .. because of what Christ did. Our focus then needs to boast in Christ alone, nothing that we do makes any difference.}*
- Do we nullify the law by faith? `v31` *{No because it is so important .. righteousness of God .. that Christ’s life and death cover us. The law is upheld by Him .. so it is very important. And should be important to us .. justice, morality, etc. .. but keeping them does not save us because we are not able to, only Christ did}*

### Ch 4
> faith = righteousness

- Abraham **believed** God, who **credited** him as righteousness 
- 4:5 However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his <ins>faith is credited as righteousness</ins>. *{treated Abraham as though he was living a righteous life. Abraham was not in himself righteous, perfect, or blameless. After we are “credited” righteous we are still wicked}*
    - To be `Saved by Faith` - we are obedient, but we don’t believe obedience saves us. We stop `working to be saved`, but we don’t stop working!  
    - God is our justifier, believing this we get credited as righteous 
    - It is not believing in a God, `but believing that only God justifies us through Christ` .. there is NO BOASTING
- Blessed are those whose sins are forgiven (from King David) *{we can be freed from self-condemning ourselves when we fail, still have the righteousness label because of him}*
- Righteousness comes by faith
- Abraham believed that God had the power to do what he said .. credited to him as righteousness. (Abraham was ~ 100 and his wife’s womb was ‘dead’, but he still believed God could do it). 
    - believing on what we know about God
    - living as his promises are true


### Ch 5
> Made right by Christ:: Received Righteousness

- Justified by faith see have
    - peace with God (legal peace - my sin required punishment legally) 
    - access to grace .. can develop a relationship with God 
    - hope of the glory of God (future with God .. excites us)
- Suffering produces perseverance; perseverance character; and character, hope
    - makes us focus (what is really important, removes distractions, etc.)
    - perseverance leads to character .. been through this before
    - drives us to one place that we place our hope in (future glory) 
- **Observation**
    - by accepting that we are justified only through grace then when experiencing suffering will deepen  our relationship with Christ. But if we are focused on works it can break us because everything is us ... doing things ... focused
- Where do we find our joy?
- While we were still sinners Christ died for us. And now even more we are saved by his life.
- Sin entered through one man Adam. So also one act of righteousness brought justification for all men .. many were made righteous *{concept of the two Adams. The 1st Adam was made by God to “represent” humanity. He had everything going for him. Just like an elected representative .. his decisions, actions were for all of us. No one could be better suited to represent us. But he still failed .. of course we would also fail.}*
- One man act made many sinners and Christ’s act made many righteous *{Adam was the pattern to come .. a new representative in Christ. Adam’s act was the breaking of the law - selfish driven. Christ’s actions was an act of righteousness - sacrifice. Adam lead to condemnation, Christ lead to justification }*
- `5:20` But where sin increased, grace increased all the more
- **Observations**:
    - God is holy, so our sins require that we be punished
    - God is gracious, so in Christ our sins are dealt with
    - Thus, we need to be always mindful that our sins are against God and mindful that he has forgiven us through the act of the cross. We should be thankful, and always remember this. Also, we can remember that this act continues to make us acceptable even when we keep failing. As as result, we are thankful and always gracious to others. 


### Ch 6
> Slaves to righteousness

- Died to sin `v2`. *{Death to sin means we no longer are controlled by sin. Does not dictate everything we do. We are changed, see things differently, etc. Of course, we still sin but our purpose, desires, perspectives, etc., all have changed. Our old way has died .. born again}*
- Do not let sin reign in our body .. obeying its desires *{sin no longer the <ins>ruling</ins> power in our lives. Before sin so ruled us we could not even see our activity as wrong}*
- Offer our body not to sin but as instruments of righteousness `v13`
- Sin can not be our master, we not under the law but under grace `v14` *{Important note that we are under grace and “works-righteousness” does not fix us. Grace frees us to find our justification only in Christ. Our motives change. We don’t do things to self-justify & make ourselves feel worthy. We have a different incentive to be instruments of righteousness .. grace}*
- Now be slaves to righteousness *{common question -- if saved only by grace then why can’t we just live anyway we want, don’t have to worry about being holy? Being a slave to God and his righteousness leads to real freedom - love, joy, peace, self-control, and kindness. Still living in slavery to sin leads to bondage.}*
- We were slaves to sin and free from the control of righteousness. Was there any benefit to the things we did that now we are ashamed of? *{There is no benefit}*
- 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord *{Paul referring to “death” in the context of a broken life}*
- **Observations:**
    - Anything we worship besides God promises much .. but delivers brokenness 


### Ch 7
> Sin is controlling

- We died to the law (no longer bound to it) through Christ dying *{we follow the “law” to please the one who saved us. We are motivated because of our relationship .. not that it justifies us. Christ already justified us. It is now about the relationship. We are now slaves to God, not sin}*
- Would have not known sin without the law (tells me I am wrong .. “don’t covet”). *{Note that the law to not covet is the 10th command .. directed at the heart. We need the law to convict us of sin so we can see the need for grace. It is easy to read the 10 commands as only externally focused.}*
- v9 .. the law came, sin sprang to life and I died.  *{It stirred up in us the desire to do the forbidden. Basically shows us the ultimate motive in life is to be God .. control our lives. We don’t like to be told what to do. Every law that God lays done is an infringement on our control. This was what happen in the Garden .. “you will be like God” (Genesis 3:4)}*
- 14-17:
    - Am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin
    - Do things that don’t really want to do .. sin is controlling me
    - It is the sin living inside that is doing these things
- 18--20:
    - No good dwells inside the sinful nature
    - End up doing evil, not good
    -It is the sin living inside that is doing it
- 22-23:
    - Inside I delight in God’s law
    - Who will save me
    - In my mind slave to God’s law
    - but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin
- **Observations:**
  - We are transformed with a new identity, but sin still exists in us with a lot of strength. But it is not who we are. The <ins>sin inside still seeks what we hate</ins>. The unbeliever can not keep the law(v7-13), but either can we (believers) on our own. Although we have changed, love God’s law, etc, sin still exist in us. The more holy we become the less holy we should feel. We can see the “self” problem more clearly as we grow.
  - Without accepting this state that we are in we will never grasp the fullness/glory of the cross. There is <ins>no  hope in ourselves</ins> for salvation or from our obedience. We only deserve judgement. 
    - our hope only on his righteousness
    - for change only on God’s Spirit transforming us
    - I am “wretched”, but God is not 

 
### Ch 8

> Life through the Spirit

- There is **<ins>no condemnation</ins>** for those who are in Christ Jesus. *{No legal punishment, a gift v5:16,18. God finds no fault in us - both in the past and in the future}*
- We are set free from the law of sin and death (bondage of sin) through His Spirit 
- *{2 aspects of sin: guilt, bondage. We are set free from both}*
- Purpose of his death and resurrection was to make us holy
- What the law could not do was accomplished by sending God’s Son to be a sin offering *{we are free from the law as a way of acceptance (legally), but obligated to keep it as a way of holiness}* 
- ..those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires `v5` *{that we are adopted as sons and loved. This is what we should dwell on. Living a life based on our own desires, versus pleasing him, only leads to brokenness. Leads to conflict, wanting things our way. Leads to slavery instead of freedom}.*
- The mind controlled by the flesh (sin nature) cannot please God.The mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace `v6`. Christians are controlled by the Spirit `v9`. 
- Our body is still dying (subject to death due to sin) but one day will be given life `v11`
- v12-13 
    - tells us to put to death the misdeeds of the body/flesh via the Spirit
    - We must remember God’s redemption of us and what He is doing and will do in the future
    - This motivates us by gratitude, not by “earning” it. There is no entitlement, we are thankful. 
    - `{PRAY}`: *Lord have mercy on me. Help me to understand your redemption of me. Enable me to know / really understand your great love. I want to be more thankful and not expect things from life .. to always go my way .. but rather respond to life based on being thankful for what you have done and are doing.*

**{v14-25 - Adoption}**
- Led by the Spirit *{hate the things the Spirit hates (sin) and love the things he loves (Christ)}
If led the Spirit than we are the children of God. We receive not fear but adoption. {divine adoption. Get all of the rights of the family we are adopted into. It is a legal act, we had nothing to do with it.}*
- We can cry “Abba, Father”. *{As a child request stuff from the father. Not a slave, thus our condition to be a family member is not performance based (fear)}*
- If Children we are heirs, sharing in suffering and glory.*{specific pain due to being a believer .. facing rejection because of who we are, what we stand for}*
- 19-22 Creation also waits, also subjected to frustration (not what it was meant to be), will be made right. Going through childbirth *{one day will all be forgotten because of what has become}*
- 23-25 We also bear pain and wait eagerly. We have hope, wait patiently. 

**{v26-39 - Confidence, Not afraid}**
- The Spirit helps us in our weakness. We don’t even know what to pray, but the Spirit intercedes for us in accordance with God’s will. *{enables us to pray when we don’t know what to pray, making the pray pleasing to our Father}*
- All things work together for the good of those who have been called according to <ins>his purpose</ins>. Predestined to be <ins>conformed to the likeness of his son</ins>. *{God makes the factors of life .. both good and bad things .. to conform us. Sure there are lots of things that are sad, depressing, etc. But things here are temporary. These events are still used to shape us, make us more like our Lord. More good comes out .. we become more shaped like Him. The difficulties are not enjoyable at all, but the results shape us for the good. God uses all things, even sin, that good comes out of. The consequences of sin are painful. So if we are following God to avoid difficulties our beliefs are wrong. It is not our circumstances that change but how we view them. For the non-believer both good and bad stuff does NOT benefit them. Good stuff makes the human heart more prideful, self-centered, etc.}*
- 31 If God is for us, who can be against us. 
- 32 He did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for all.  Will then graciously give us all things. 
- 33-34 Who will bring a charge against those who have chosen? God justifies. Christ died, rose, intercedes for us.
- 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Hardship? 
- 37-39 Nothing can separate us for the love of Christ .. death, life, angels or demons, now or the future .. nothing at all.

### Ch 9
> God is in control - the [doctrine of election](#doctrine-of-election)

- Paul has heavy *sorrow for the Israelites* (who would sacrifice knowing Christ for them) .. they were given the covenants, the law, temple worship, and the Messiah came from their ancestry. 
- 10-13 God chose Jacob for his purpose. It is not by works that we are elected. 
- 16 Does not depend on man’s effort or desire, but on God’s mercy. 
- 18 God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and hardens whom he wants to harden. *{When God hardens he does not produce it, just allows the person to go their own way}*
- *{spiritual faith is ultimately a function of God’s choice. There is no superiority of a believer over an unbeliever. Salvation is about his mercy and his gift, not our work and our right.}*
- 19-20 “..why does God still blame us?” *{God made us, we are not the creator}*
- 23 Shows His mercy .. whom he prepared in advance for glory *{somehow by selecting some and passing over others we will see more of his glory}*
- 24 “.. call them my people, who are not ..” *{picks who He wants}*
Israel’s rejection was due to unbelief (they took control over from him, it became about them). 
- The Gentiles obtained righteousness by faith. *{They did not have the law, never pursued righteousness, yet were more open to the gospel. The Jews on the other hand had everything -- history, the Law, etc. -- but it became about them earning their way in. Thus they missed it. Sought to create their own righteousness}.*
- “.. a stone that causes people to stumble .. “ (Isaiah 28:16, 8:14) - quoting 2 verses
- `Terms`:
    - `Mercy` - <ins>getting</ins> blessings that we don’t deserve / owed
    - `Grace` - <ins>not getting</ins> punishment that we do deserve  / owed


### Ch 10
> Believe and be saved

- Had zeal <ins>without</ins> knowledge. Israelites <ins>did not submit</ins> to God’s righteousness. They tried to establish their own righteousness through the law 
- Christ is the <ins>end of the law</ins> (not acceptable to God through obeying the law) so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes *{we still obey the law as a way to please and show our gratitude}*
- v9 **If you confess with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him, you will be saved .. both Jews and Gentiles.** *{requires belief in the person and work of Christ}*
- v11 Anyone who trust in him will not be ashamed
- v12 All who call on his name will be saved 
- v14 Must preach the news {persuading someone}
- v18 The Jews did hear {They were given the prophets, etc, but still did not seek God}
- v21 “..disobedient and obstinate people” [Isaiah 65:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2065%3A2&version=ESV)


### Ch 11
> Gentiles included

- God has <ins>not</ins> rejected his people (Israel):
    - Paul is a Jew
    - Predestined Jews to come to him
    - There has always been a remanent 
- God harden those with a proud spirit *{Rejection of God leads to rejection from God}*

- v22 Continue in His kindness (grace)
- V24 The Jews can be brought back in
- v25-26 ..hardening to so Gentiles come in. All Israel will be saved *{a possible - steady growth of Christian Jews -- a great number of them}*
- 31 There will be no distinction between Jews and Gentiles .. “..so that he many have  mercy on them all” 
- 33-36 `Doxology`
    - how great and deep is the wisdom God.. way over my head
    - who can explain God? who can give Him advice?
    - who has given God anything that should be repaid?
    - from Him and through Him are all things
    - To Him be glory forever


### Ch 12
> Be transformed, be “doers”

- 1: Therefore *{based on all that has been explained .. grace (i.e. chap 8) }* offer our body as a <ins>living sacrifice</ins> ... holy and pleasing to God *{old testament there were “sin” offerings that required shedding blood, and asking forgiveness. This is what Jesus did for us. The other type of whole burnt offering - animal from the flock without defects}*
    - *{as continuous and daily giving of our lives to obedience to God}*
    - *{being motivated out of gratitude -- he already is pleased with us}*
    - *{our goal is now to “please” God, not others -- different view}*
- 2: Do not conform to this world, but be transformed. Able to test and understand God’s will

- **PRAY**:

- 3: Do not think more of yourself. Use sober judgement *{neither too low or too high}*
- *{Gospel prevents us from thinking more highly of ourselves .. we are sinners. It also prevent to lowly thinking .. we are loved by the Father}*
- 4-8: We all have different gifts, according to the grace given us. Prophesying, servicing, contributing to the needs of others, etc. 
  - *{General types of gifts:*
    - *Speaking*

- 10-16: *{Loving other believers}*
    - 10a: Be devoted to one another {like family members}
    - 10b: Honor others above yourself {put others 1st, all are created in God’s image. Listen, be attentive, be sincere. Real love is not concentrating on our own needs}
    - 11-12: <ins>Patient</ins>
        - joyful in hope

    - 13 <ins>Share</ins> with people in need, hospitable 
    - 16a Live in harmony with one another
    - 16b Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. *{focused on the needs of others, not our image}*
    - 16c Do not be conceited. 
- 17:21: *{Loving your enemy}*
    - 17 Do not repay evil for evil {see evil as something distinct from the person}
    - 18 Live at peace with everyone
    - 19 Do not take revenge
    - 20 If my enemy is hungry feed him. In doing so heap burning coals on his head *{repentance may come}*
  - 21 Overcome evil with good
- **Observations**:
    - The gospel reminds us that (1) God was patient with us to come to him and is still patient with us with our ongoing flaws (2) We are sinners. If a person is a believer or not we are no better
    - Thus, we have nothing to prove .. God gives us our worth. We find our hope in Him, not in who we are associated with.
    - Christ-like love of others has a cost; not to earn the other person’s love or God’s love, but in response to what He has done for us. 


### Ch 13
> Respect authority, Love your neighbor

- 1 Submit to authority. The authority that exist has been established by God.
- 4 The one in authority is God’s servant for your good 
- 6-7 We pay taxes, give honor, etc. 
- Love your fellow man
    - 9-10 Love your neighbor as yourself .. love does no harm to its neighbor {by obeying the law. Love does not overlook sin}
- 11 The time is near *{our time in this world is very short. We should always live as the end is near. Should focus on eternal things}*
- 13 behave, as in daytime. *{Live as though all of our actions are in the light}*


### Ch 14
> The Weak and the Strong - disputable matters

- *{Areas of practice for which God has not specifically spoken of in his word}*
- 1 Accept the one who is weaker in faith concerning disputable matters {In Rome the issue was mostly surrounding food .. should not eat meat. But in verse 5 certain “holy” days were an issue. Verse 21 drinking of wine was an issue}
- 3 Should not judge each other for eating or not eating *{weaker Christians have not worked out the implications of the gospel ... if you are saved by faith alone there is no need to feel you can somehow keep God’s favor through rules}*
- 3b-12 *{the weak}*
    - 5 who are you to judge someone else’s servant
    - 6 fully convinced in your own mind {can I do this before Christ?}
    - 10 why judge? We will all stand before God’s judgment
- 13b-21 *{the strong}*
    - 13b don’t put a stumbling block in the way of a brother or sister *{could cause a weaker brother to start doing something they are not clear on doing. Without faith it is sin v23}*
    - *{Meat is now considered clean. Possible reason for the OT food laws to teach the people that to come to God you had to be pure. Now in Christ we are pure.}*
    - 14 If you consider it unclean than it is
    - 15 ... No longer acting in love. Can destroy *{the work of Christ}* another believer
  - 17 But the kingdom of God is NOT about what I eat or drink ..**it is about righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit**. *{The focus should not be on freedom, but how I can build up others in the Lord}*
    - 19 Do everything we can to bring peace and mutual edification
    - 21 Do not do things that make a brother stumble .. 
- 22 whatever I believe about things <ins>keep between myself and God</ins>
- 23 Everything that does not come from faith is sin
- `QUESTION v17`: What does “joy in the Holy Spirit” look like? We all enjoy eating food, etc., but we are commanded to focus on being righteousness and having joy in the Holy Spirit. 


### Ch 15
> Unity, Mission

- Should build our neighbor up, never doing things just to please ourselves *{neighbor would include everyone}*. 3 ... Christ did not do things for himself
- 4  ... through endurance and encouragement of the scriptures we have hope
- 5-6 ... one mind and one voice you may glorify God *{Unity, can worship together}*
- 7 Accept one another, just as we have been accepted *{understanding the Gospel enables us to accept others. We are loved and accepted with all of our flaws .. do the same to others}* 
- 8 Christ a servant of the Jews .. the promises to the patriarchs be confirmed
- 9 Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy *{has always been the plan to include both Jews and Gentiles}*
- 13 Over with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit
- 16 ... priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God *{in the OT there were 2 offerings: sin offering and burnt and thanksgiving offering. Christ in our sin offering. Christians bring themselves as the thanksgiving offering. This is Paul’s offering - proclaiming the gospel, Gentiles being converted.}* Leading Gentiles to obey God by <ins>word</ins> and <ins>deed</ins>
- 26-27 Helping the poor. Pleased to do it.*{Grace makes us debtors to those in need}*
- 30-31 ... by praying to God for me (Paul). *{our service to other Christians}*


### Ch 16
> Personal greetings

- Gettings *{8+ of the 26 were women .. very active in the ministry}*
- 17-18 Watch out for those who cause divisions .. keep away from them. They are not serving the Lord but themselves 
- 19 Be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil
- 26 ... so that all Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from faith
