## Observations

- By grace, we are saved. Once we were just pursuing the cravings of our sinful nature. But now saved by faith, nothing that we have done. We have nothing to boast about ... we did not do it.
- We can approach God in confidence. Christ really loves us. 
- But we are now to live pure and holy lives. Not living like non-believers who indulge in every kind of impurity and always want more. We need to live differently. Need to be humble, always maintaining unity, gentle. But again we have nothing to brag about ... it is all through Christ. 
- Sing to the Lord, always gives thanks!!
- Love your wife, treat your kids well with Godly instruction.
- Pray for all your request
