## Overview

- [Introduction to Galatians](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-galatians/)
- Paul wrote this letter around 50AD (15-20 years after the death of Christ)
- Certain Jewish Christians believed in many OT practices (i.e. circumcision). A group of teachers were insisting that Gentile Christians practice traditional ceremonial customs of the law of Moses, just as they did (dietary, circumcision, etc.) 
- Questioned Paul’s authority .. he was softening the message for Gentiles. 
- It is by <ins>grace through faith alone</ins> that we are justified (not the bondage of legalism)
- The basic message of this book (and Romans) brought about the **Protestant Reformation**

## Observations

- Only by faith, we are saved. Not be works. 
- We are given cultural freedom
- We are motivated out of a response of gratitude 
- We can not slip back into thinking that “doing stuff” justifies us. Legalism does not work. A form of **works-righteousness**. We always need to rest in the knowledge that only through Christ we are justified .. just trust in him. Faith Alone! Example given in 3:6 that Abraham was viewed as righteous, not because of how he lived but rather by **believing**. Note, you can’t <ins>believe God</ins> without <ins>believing in God</ins>. But you can believe in God, without believing God ([James 2:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202%3A19&version=ESV) says that even “demons believe”). 
- Legalism separates us from others. We are all equal -- male, female, Jew, Gentile, Slave, etc. 
- Because of Christ, we receive full rights as God’s children
- Whatever the reason that God commands how his people should live it is NOT to gain acceptance to Him. Belief. 
- Love your neighbor as yourself
- love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control ... these are the characteristics of a Godly person - Not being legalistic 
- It is a lot easier to follow guidelines, rules, steps, etc. than having real character. Requiring “stuff” separates people, we become more judgemental -- because we are doing “stuff”. But relying solely on God’s grace how can we then be judgemental? Allowing God to change us and have real “fruits” requires trust. Other people can’t always see these traits at the surface level, but only have they get to really know us. This is completely opposite of the way our culture works now. 
- **Gospel** - we <ins>don’t</ins> try to gain our righteousness <ins>through our own work</ins>. Rather we receive it through the supernatural work of God through Jesus coming to the world and dying for our sins.

## Chapters (6)

### Ch 1
> Paul confronting a false gospel


- 1 Sent from God, not by man
- 4 ... rescued us from this evil world (msg) {the core of the gospel: not wise sayings, good lifestyle; but being saved ... God’s doing}
    - *{saved by who we believe in}*
- 6 **astonished** about the Galatians turning to a **false gospel**. 7 not a gospel at all
- 8 even if an angel from heaven preaches a different gospel ... under God’s curse *{the Gospel is God given, not changeable. The Bible is our truth, not someone's reflection on what is good. The Bible judges the church, the church does not judge the Bible}*
- 12 Paul received the message by revelation from Jesus Christ. By God’s will meant to peach to the Gentiles. 
- 13 persecuted the church of God
- 14 advancing in Judaism, extremely zealous 
- *{Although Paul was doing much wrong he was called by God and his previous wrongdoings were used by; and prepared him for, his current purpose}*
- 18-21 Establishing himself (Paul) as an apostles 

### Ch 2
> Faith Alone

- After 14 years went to Jerusalem to meet with other apostles. He presented the gospel to them which he had been preaching to the Gentiles. 2 Wanted to be sure he was not running his “race in vain” *{issue was with people’s own cultural prejudices that affectaffects their teaching of the gospel. Christianity is for all people, not a reformed version of Judaism}*
- Titus, a greek, was with Paul at the meeting; not compelled to get circumcised
- 9 confirmed Paul was an apostleapostles focusing on the Gentiles. Gave the right hand of fellowship *{by including Paul, Barnabas, and Titus they were “excluding” the false teachers}*
- 10 ... continue to remember the poor *{throughout the bible we are instructed to care for the poor}*
- *{`Context`. In the Old Testament, the “ceremonial” law was a teaching method by which God showed you can’t go into his presence unclean. The new law is that no one is unclean in Christ .. even the Gentiles. Peter is eating with the gentiles, then stops doing so}.*
- 11 Later Paul confronts Peters and others about them not staying from Gentiles based on the influence of this other circumcision group. *{Most likely racial pride was also influencing Peter. Growing up Gentiles were viewed as unclean, pagans, etc... Cultural differences were influencing him. Application: We often use our style, and preferences to feel better than others. An exampleExample might be the type of music our church uses; more emotional responses, etc.}*
- 16 We are justified by faith in Jesus Christ (not by observing the law)  *{We are all the same, no better no worse than others. Quit trying to feel superior based on works-righteousness}.*
- 19 ... died to the law (works-righteousness) so that I might live for God *{our pursuit of holiness comes out of thankful, <ins>not</ins> to be justified}*
- 21 Righteousness can only be gained through Christ dying on the cross 

### Ch 3
> The righteous shall live by faith

- 1 Asking what happened? Christ was clearly explained as crucified. 
- 2 When they believed they received the spirit and miracles were performed (not by following the law)
- 3 Now they are trying to gain God’s favor through human efforts (not faith) *{you don’t begin by faith and then proceed by works}*
- 5 We received the Spirit because we believed! *{the Spirit works in us as we believe .. rest in Christ’s completed work}*
- 6 Abraham *{father of the Jews}* is the example of <ins>believing</ins> *{God is viewing Abraham as if he were living a righteous life}*. Gen 15:6 Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. Gen 15:18 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said ..
- 8 ... foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith ... gospel in advance to Abraham 
- 10 ... relying on the works of the law is a curse. The law is not based on faith 12 Christ redeemed us from the law ... he became the curse 13 {became sin ... <ins>sinner</ins>}
- 14 through Christ we might receive the promise of the Spirit {we getting the blessing because he was the substitute for our curse. we become <ins>righteous and stay righteous</ins>}
  
> What is the purpose of the Law

- 17-18 A promise was given to Abraham -- blessing of God -- to be received by faith. The law was given 430 years later to show us our sin. *{The law does not set aside/void the promise. They are mutually exclusive. God will keep his promise, all we have to do is believe}*
- 19 The law came because of transgressions, until Christ had come *{let us know we are sinners}*
- *{The Law shows us that we are completely under the power of sin. It points us to our need of salvation by grace.}*
- 24 the law was our supervisor until we found Christ (grace). 25 We are no longer under its supervision.*{we still live in a similar manner ... obeying the law out of gratitude. This is a much stronger motivation. We have to understand how really sinful we are ... the law. Than we are extremely grateful that we are still fully accepted ... out of this we want to obey}*
- 26 in Christ we are children of God through faith *{sonship}*
- 27 baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ *{our identity, closeness, covers our shame}*
- 28 not just the Jewish nation. We are all one in Christ - not Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male or female. *{I am a Christian before I am anything else}*
- 29 and heirs according to the promise *{made to Abraham}*

### Ch 4
> Galatians moving back to regulations

- 5 God sent his Son to redeem those under the law to receive full rights as Sons. We are adopted into God’s family
- 6 Because we are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son in our hearts, calls out “Abba, Father” *{through the Spirit we experience real emotion}*
- 7 No longer a slave to the law, but God’s child, an heir *{removing the curse and getting the blessing of being his Son}*
- 9 God knows us *{we are his children}* turning back ... wish to be enslaved by them again? *{in their past they lived immoral lifestyles}*
- 10 observing special days and months, etc. *{they are not doing immoral stuff like in the past, but they are being taught to “earn” their righteousness. Both approaches ... pursing fulfillment through worldly passion, and observing religious stuff, are idols. We need to save ourselves.Work-righteousness ... attending church, bible reading, etc., ... always creates idols. Good example is the prodigal son story concerning the older brother.}* 
- *{when we understand that God knows us; that is our insurance and then we don’t have to work to belong ... no more work-righteousness idols. Than our love is based on awe and wonder ... why do we deserve such treatment? Because we are his sons and daughters!}*
- 12 ... become like me, for I became like you *{we don’t need to change everyone to like what we like culturally}*
- 13 because of an illness that he preached to them *{things do not alway go according to our plans. God works in spite of our plans. If Paul did not get sick there would be no Galatians?}*.
- 17 false teachers want zeal for themselves *{false teachers saying you want to be the “children” of Abraham, the chosen ones, than you must follow the law}*
- 21 Want to be under the law? *{meaning to use following the law to ensure our standing before God .. how He views us}
- 23 Abraham son by the free woman was born by a divine promise. {Hagar’s son Ishmael was them trying to make God’s promise happen based on their own efforts}*
- 25 Hagar represents the present city of Jerusalem, slavery *{mapping Abraham’s own effort to fulfill God’s promise to the Gentiles. They are being just like Abraham trying to earn God’s acceptance}.*
- 27 (quoting Isaiah 54:1) .. more are the children of the desolate women ... *{Paul showing how God uses the weak. Does not matter where you come from. You can not do this on your own .. works.}*
- 29 ... son born of the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. *{the people doing work-righteousness will always persecute those enjoying saved-by-grace}*

### Ch 5
> Losing freedom through works-righteousness, abusing freedom with no rules for holiness

- 1 Freedom in Christ. Stand firm. Don’t be burdened by the yoke of slavery. *{not to fall back into being a slave, this time a slave to work-righteousness through the law. Before it was through pagan idolatry}.*
- 2-3 If circumcised Christ has no value. Obligated to follow the whole law. *{warning not to go after a system (law) to earn God’s approval. Christ did it all. This group was teaching that unless you are circumcised you cannot be saved - Acts 15:1,5}.*
- 4 Trying to be justified by the law is being alienated from Christ; falling from grace. 
- 5 We confidently wait for righteousness {being made right}
- 6 The only thing that counts in **faith expressed in love** *{neither moral effort or moral failure count. Application - I can always feel accepted by God. It is not about me, being good enough to feel acceptable to God. When I mess up ... oh well. As a response, knowing I am accepted no matter what, I can love others more}*
- 11 if preaching circumcision why being persecuted? 
- 12 ... emasculate themselves *{Paul is angry with these preaching work-righteousness}*
- 13 Do not use our freedom (saved by grace) to indulge in our sinful nature *{We don’t live guilty (earning our way) nor an unholy life}*
- 14 The entire law is summed up in a single command: Love your neighbor as yourself
- 16 Walk by the Spirit ... not gratifying the desires of our sinful nature
- 17 Spirit and Flesh are in conflict. You are not to do whatever you want. *{Over desiring things; replacing God ... IDOLS. The flesh desires “created things”, the Spirit desires God & to conform us to His likeness. We have both desires working in us.}*
- 18 Lead by the Spirit *{being who we were designed to be}*
- *{We have two intact motivational systems - old self/sinful nature and the new self/led by the Spirit. They still compete with each other. We are to be lead by the Spirit}.*
- 19-21 The acts of the flesh ... will not inherit the kingdom of God. *{sex and drink same level as jealousy and selfish ambition}*
- 22 The **fruit of the Spirit** is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control *{we tend to see <ins>gifts</ins> as a sign of the Spirit’s work in someone's life, but the Bible never does} {these gifts growth together when the Spirit is working in us. Otherwise more temperament}.*
    - love - not for what you get
    - joy - delight in God
    - peace - confidence, rest in God
    - patience - ability to face trouble
    - kindness - ability to serve others 
    - goodness - same person in every situation
    - faithfulness - reliable and true to your word
    - gentleness - humility, self-forgetfulness
    - self-control - ability to pursue important over the urgent
- 21 Don’t become conceited *{deep insecurity, a need to prove our worth}*, provoking *{superiority}* and envying *{inferiority}*. *{both types of behavior is **self-absorbed**}*

### Ch 6
> Doing Good to All

- 1 caught in a sin, restore gently *{not out of conceit, but also humble, could happen to us}*
- 2 Carry each other's <ins>burdens</ins> *{lighting a heavy load}*
- 3 think we are something, but we are not *{need Christ-centered humility}*
- 4 we can take pride in ourselves, without comparing
- 5 we should carry our own <ins>load</ins> *{all of us have struggles we are required to go through, not the same as a heavy burden v4, where we might need help from a brother}*
- 6 share {support $} the instructor(s). *{also includes fellowship}*
- 7 A man reaps what he sows ... pleases his sinful nature reaps destruction, pleases the Spirit eternal life *{sin makes things fall apart ... never brings joy}*
- 9-10 Do not grow weary of <ins>doing good</ins> ... especially to believers
- 12 Trying to impress others ... persecuted for the cross of Christ *{liberals find it intolerant, conservatives don’t like good people are in the same state as bad people}*
- 14 Only boast about the cross *{Christ justifies us ... <ins>not</ins> work righteousness}*
- 15 ... only the new creation matters 
- 16 Peace and mercy to those who follow this <ins>rule</ins> *{nothing else matters but the cross, new creation, ... the gospel}*
