### Bible Project
TBD


### Purpose
TBD


### Outline (28 chapters)
TBD

### Difficulties
- Why would they cast lots to pick the replacement disciple (1:26)?


## Observations
- Things did not always go smoothly. Paul is performing miracles, people are converting and then he is stoned and left for dead. There is confusion over accepting Gentiles and if so what are their requirements. There were disputes among the Christian leaders. Paul and Barnabas parted ways over bringing Mark or not.  
- Many miracles were performed. For example, when Paul was shipwrecked at an Island he was bit by a snake and nothing happened. Next, the people of the Island bring their sick and are healed. Peter prays for a Lady who had died, she is brought back to life.
- Jews would always get very upset when it was stated that the Gentiles were included
- Paul would argue about Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament
