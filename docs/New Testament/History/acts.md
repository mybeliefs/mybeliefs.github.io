None


### Observations

- The Holy Spirit's arrival empowered the group to spread the message of Christ dying for their sins.
- Because of persecution, the gospel spread through the region and beyond.
- Things did not always go smoothly. Paul is performing miracles, people are converting and then he is stoned and left for dead.
- Jews would always get very upset when it was stated that the Gentiles were included.
- There is confusion over accepting Gentiles and if so what are their requirements? They define these requirements - no idols, sexual immorality, etc.
- There were disputes among the Christian leaders. Paul and Barnabas parted ways over bringing Mark or not.
- Many miracles were performed. For example, when Paul was shipwrecked on an Island he was bitten by a snake and nothing happened. Next, the people of the Island bring their sick and are healed. Peter prays for a Lady who has died, she is brought back to life.
- Paul would always argue that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament.
