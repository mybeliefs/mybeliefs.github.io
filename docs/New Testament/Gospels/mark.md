- Focuses more on what Jesus did than what he said
- Date ~ 50s or 60s A.D., likely written in Rome, before the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70

### Survey Overview
[Four Portraits, One Jesus: A Survey of Jesus and the Gospels](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Portraits-Jesus-Audio-Lectures/dp/B01CE0373U/) by Mark Strauss

- Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God. The suffering servant, paying the price for our sin.
- Came to serve, not be served. Mark 10:45
- Emphasis on Jesus’ authority in teaching and miracles
- Lengthy passion narrative, a brief resurrection narrative
- List more **miracles** than the other gospels (1st 8 chapters)
- Jesus had claims/acts on things thought only available to God (Forgiveness, annuls OT dietary laws, lordship over the Sabbath).
- Conflicts:
  - Spiritual ones - tempted by Satan, demons 
  - Religious leaders 
- Suffering Son of God (2nd 8 chapters) 
  - Confession of Peter - “the Christ” (8:27-29)
  - Radically redefines the role of the Messiah 
  - Did not come to be served, but to serve 10:45
- The ending (16:1-8) provides very little details after the resurrection. The additional verses 9-20 seem to be an add-on. Seems like a copyist added the text. 
- The primary purpose was to show that Jesus was the Christ, the promised Messiah. Not that he was God in the flesh. 
- The portrait of the disciples is mostly negative. Unwilling to accept the suffering role of the Messiah. 
- There is no account of the recovery of the disciples
- It is the outsiders, sinners & gentiles, who are examples of faith
- Theology:
  - The Kingdom of God. The Jews were persecuted and longed for the day that God would intervene to establish his kingdom on earth. Mark’s gospel presents it as the person of Jesus - the present and the future.
  - Jesus fulfills the role of the Messiah as the humble servant (Isaiah 53)
  - Discipleship is willing to pick up the cross and follow, including suffering

### Purpose
- Demonstrates Jesus by describing so many miracles  
- Call to a relationship with Jesus - trusting, confessing, self-denial. 
- Preparing readers for persecution

### Difficulties
- 29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness.
- 9:1 - “.. who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God ..”
- 9 - Transfiguration {purpose?}
- 13:30 this generation will not pass away until these things take place? {Is he saying that the disciples should see/experience all of these predictions?)
- What is sinning against the Holy Spirit 3:29?


## Observations
- Jesus disrupts religious leaders. He becomes famously quick because of his healings/miracles and speaking. Image a person healing the sick! But he did not follow the rules set up by the Pharisees. He even feeds 5000 and walks on water.
- What comes out of my heart is what defiles me: bad thoughts, greed, deceit, etc. Don’t let traditions get in the way of having a pure heart. 
- To save your life you must deny yourself? What does this mean? We need to pursue God and his purposes, not our own (natural tendencies of me first). 
- We need to just believe .. 9:24 “I believe; help me overcome my unbelief”. Trusting in God often still includes doubt. Later we are told to receive the “kingdom of God” like a little child 10:15. So trust and belief can be simple .. not overly complicated. Ask, believe, and you will receive it - 11:24. Can this be? 
- Everyone left him when he was arrested; Peter denied Jesus three times. But all were restored. 
- He died for our sins, the ultimate sacrifice. Then he rose.
