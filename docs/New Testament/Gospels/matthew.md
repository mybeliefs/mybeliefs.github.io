**Theme:**
- Jesus is the promised King (messiah) from David’s line (stated 9 times)
- His messiahship is revealed through self-sacrificial love, not conquest
- Fulfills the Old Testament
- The kingdom is present now because of the presence of Jesus with his people
- No longer under the old covenant, but are under the new and greater covenant. Came not to abolish the **law**, but to fulfill it. The purpose of the law:
  - (1) Reveal God’s righteous standards
  - (2) Provide the means to remain in a covenant relationship with him.
  - Both are fulfilled in Jesus.
  - The law is now defined as an “attitude of the heart”. This is summed up in the commandments to love God and love your neighbor (22:40).
- Not really known if the community had completely broken away from Judaism yet (i.e. banned from the synagogue).

### Difficulties

- 24:34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. {What generation is being referenced?}
- 27:52-53 52 The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, 53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.

## Observations

- Heals so many people (i.e. chapters 8,9). I got to believe this would draw huge crowds and the word about Jesus would spread quickly. 
- So many instructions about life. For example:
  - 5:16 “In the same way, let your **ligh**t shine before others, that they may see your **good deeds** and glorify your Father in heaven.”
  - Let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No’
  - How to pray .. “don’t babble when  you pray” (6:7)
  - Do not worry 6:25
  - Do not judge 7:1
- Eats with sinners.
- Love God more than our family 10:37
- God sees the heart. “But their hearts are far from me”. Isaiah 29:13. We are not to just follow rules to be honored by men. Often we are motivated by what others will see/think of us. We are not driven by a desire to serve/honor God, but rather by what our peers will think. 
- What we say is a reflection of our heart (ch 15). 
- Deny ourselves .. (16:24). Are we really willing to deny ourselves and follow Christ? Does this mean “your will be done”? Often we think in terms of God fulfilling our desires. It is about us, not Him. 
- States “nothing is impossible” with faith. This is stated in the context of the disciples failing to heal a boy with seizures. How are we to look at this? What does faith look like? 
- Mercy on others .. we are given mercy by our Father
- Great are those that serve others. This is the complete opposite of the culture. 
- The greatest command: Love God & Love your neighbor 
23:12 For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
- The great commission: 28:19
