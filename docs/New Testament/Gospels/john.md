### Difficulties
TBD

## Observations
- Christ (the Word) is God and became flesh - ch. 1:1-2, 14.
- Gave us the right to become children of God .. must be born again (ch 3). He gave his only Son that we might have eternal life. God sent Christ to save the world, not condemn it (3:17)
- People will stand condemned if they do not believe in Jesus 3:18
- The Jewish authorities (ch 5) were highly offended because Jesus was calling God his own Father (blasphemy). Question - would this not be a normal response? Someone shows up and calls himself God (indirectly). What events/actions should have changed their minds? Nicodemus changed his mind! 
- Jesus states that Moses wrote about him 5:46 
  - Hebrews explains how Christ brings a new covenant versus Old Testament 
     -Permanent Priest 
    - Does not need to continually offer sacrifices (one time only) 
    - Only Christ’s death was sufficient to take away sins
  - Reference - Reference content on [StackExchange](https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/7118/where-did-moses-write-about-jesus)
    - Wrote many things that “foreshadowed the coming of the Messiah”
      - Passover Lamb
      - Manna in the desert, Jesus is the Bread from Heaven (John 6:51)
      - Etc
- Lots of confusion and disagreement on who Jesus was ch. 7. He did miracles, spoke like no one else. Some accused him of being demon-possessed (ch 8)
- Can only come to Christ if God draws us
- We are slaves to our sins; Christ sets us free (ch 8)
- Is the good shepherd (ch 10). We know his voice!
- The raising Lazarus from the dead was a major event prompting planning by the Jewish leaders to take his life (ch 11)
- Some will not believe 12 (Isaiah 6:10 .. blinded their heart)
- Calls us to love one another .. this way the world will know we are his disciples’ ch 13
- Being a follower requires loving other brothers and sisters 13:35
- Only through Christ to the Father 14:6
- We can ask for anything in his name 14:9. Was this only applicable for the disciples? 
- This Holy Spirit will teach us 14. Can rely on the Holy Spirit to reveal God’s truth to us. 
- If we love Jesus we obey his commands 14. 
- We can only bear fruit if we stay connected to Christ. He wants us to bear fruit. 15
- Jesus prayed that we (believers) might be one 17
- Jesus is arrested, treated badly, denied by Peter, flogged, crucified. “It is finished”. Appears to Mary and the disciples. Shows himself to Thomas the doubter. “Blessed are those who believe without seeing” 20. 
- Restores Peter -- “do you love me ..”
- **Overall**:
  - There was always lots of confusion on who Jesus was? Was he crazy, demon-possessed, or truly from God? Nothing he did was normal - healed even on the Sabbath, hung out with sinners, made weird statements (“eat my flesh”, “I am the resurrection”), etc. Was offering salvation to the poor, outcast, non-religious.  But his words and deeds were compelling.
  - *Lord, I ask that I might always desire to follow you. Save me from me, trying to find my own happiness. I was created to be dependent on you... I don’t work unless I live for you .. even in my total weakness. I ask “in your name” that through the “advocate” you would reveal yourself more to me.*
