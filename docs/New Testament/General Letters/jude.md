## Overview

- The author half brother of Jesus (had 4 brothers)
- Neither James nor Jude ever describes themselves as a brother to Jesus, others do
- Written to believers very familiar with the Old Testament scriptures and “other” literature
- References other material outside the bible (i.e. the book of Moses)
- Uses OT and other Jewish literature to demonstrate how rebellious people/leaders receive divine judgment

### Bible Project

- Warns against corrupt Leaders
- Corrupt teachers have got into the church. 
- Not the teaching per se, but their immoral lifestyle 
- Examples from the OT, and other literature 

### Purpose
