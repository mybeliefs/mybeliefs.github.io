- `Summary`:
    - Trials develop perseverance
    - We should ask for wisdom when we lack it

    - Favouritism is forbidden; Poor people are as precious as rich people.
    - Love your neighbour as yourself
    - If I say that I have faith and show no evidence of it by a changed lifestyle that produces good works towards others, then I do not have saving faith
    - Personal trust in God for salvation changes the true believer’s entire life - i.e., which will show evidence by what they do!

  - ... will show you my faith by my works `18`
  - ... even the demons believe `19`
  - ... faith apart from works is useless? `20`
  - ... faith is completed by works `22`
  - You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. `24`
  - ... **faith apart from works is dead** `26`
- `Notes` (BibleRef - What does James chapter 2 mean?):
  - *However, while Paul emphasizes the "cause," which is trusting faith, James emphasizes the "effect," which is good works.*
  - *James stresses that so-called "faith", which is merely mental agreement and does not produce good and loving works, is not a genuine, saving faith.*
  - *"James refers to good works as an expected outcome of salvation, not the source of it."* (Chapter Context)

## Observations

- Faith is not just a mental belief, an acceptance of the existence of a God.
- God’s mercy toward us is reflected in our character, who we are, and what we do. His mercy and forgiveness show themselves in our actions.
  - We control our tongue!
  - We care about others who are less fortunate.
- Spirituality/Wisdom is shown by how we live: peaceful, considerate, humble, etc.
- Pray when we have trouble, and sing praise when we are happy.
