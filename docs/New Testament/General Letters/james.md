## Observations

- Faith is just <ins>not</ins> a mental belief, acceptance of the existence of a God. 
- God’s mercy to us is reflective in our character, who we are, what we do. His mercy and forgiveness shows itself in **our actions**. We can **control our tongue!** We care about others who are less fortunate. 
- Spirituality/Wisdom is shown by how we live: peaceful, considerate, humble, etc. 
- Pray when we have trouble, sing when we have praise.
