### Difficulties
- Chapter 7. The concept of Melchizedek the high priest during Abraham’s time. Stated he was “without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life...” v7:3.  This is called a theophany (appearance of a god to a human). Not sure how to interpret this. 

## Observations
- Christ is God 1:3-4. So many OT references. 
- Jesus is the new revelation of God versus the OT Prophets ... a new covenant. He is the Son of God. Created all things and made us right by being the perfect **1-time only sacrifice (the cross)**. 
- Is our new high priest ... versus the old system ... that understands our weakness. He also became a man. We always have access to our priest - Jesus
- Our hearts are hardened by sin’s deceitfulness. Just like the Jews in the desert who did not enter God’s rest. <ins>Hard hearts</ins> and <ins>unbelief</ins> always prevent God’s gracious blessings in our lives. 
- The old system of sacrifice did not really work. Christ replaces the old system - new covenant. 
- **Without Faith you can <ins>not</ins> please God** ... trusting in what we do not see. We must believe that He exists {“Lord help my faith. Help me see you more clearly. *Allow me to believe so I can enter your rest*”.}
- Blesses those who <ins>earnestly seek Him</ins>
- **Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see 11:1**
- We are to fear God, in a reverent way. We are to seek holiness. We need to seek God. It is easy to use God for our own agenda. No, we need to seek Him, love others, don’t love money, etc., ... pursue holiness. Fear of God is good for us!
- Always offer God our praise
