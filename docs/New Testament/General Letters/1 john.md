### Bible Project
https://thebibleproject.com/explore/1-3-john/

- Overseeing house churches
    - Made up of Jewish followers
    - Going through a crisis
- Not a letter, more of a sermon
- Based on the teachings from the gospel of John
- Lots of hyperbole
- God is LIGHT. God is LOVE
- GOD = FATHER and the SON
- (1) GOD is LIGHT
    - Keep Jesus commands
    - When fail, He forgives us
    - Love one another
    - Don’t love the world; pride and sexual sin
    - We show in the family by doing righteousness  
- (2) GOD is LOVE
    - Does away with fear
    - Comes by trusting God
    - Jesus is GOD
    - Keep away from Idols

### Purpose
- Seek a holy life
- Love you other brothers and sisters in the Lord
- Expose false teachers
- Give believers assurance of salvation

### Outline (5 chapters)
1. Do not walk in the dark, Jesus purifies us from sin, confess he forgives
2. Must walk as Jesus did, Do not love the world
3. We do not keep on sinning, love is an action
4. Love one another, perfect love drives out fear
5. Have the Son have eternal life, Ask according to his will, Born of God does not keep sinning

### Difficulties
- Ch `2 v27`. Talks about not needing a teacher because anointed by Christ. How does this apply to pastors in a church preaching on Sunday?  

## Observations
- Knowing Christ a person will not keep on sinning, making a practice of it. A real believer will seek righteousness ...to be like Christ.
    - We all sin, but if we confess he will forgive us. But we can not continue walking in the dark and have fellowship with God
- We are not to love this world ... sinning, lusting, boasting of what we have accomplished, have, etc. But we are to love our brothers.
- I can not hate my brother and say that I love God .. this does not work
- In `summary`:
    - we are changed! 
    - we love our brothers
    - we continually seek righteousness
    - we are not of this world ... lust, boasting, etc.
- `Question`: How do we love our fellow believers? 3:17-18 When we see a believer in need we help them!

- 7 Love one another, for love, comes from God
    - 9 God showed us His love by sending his son as a sacrifice
    - 10 ... but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sin
