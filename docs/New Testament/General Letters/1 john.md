### Bible Ref
https://www.bibleref.com/1-john

- The apostle John is the author. External evidence from early church fathers
- Dealing with problems of false teachers
- Develops the themes of fellowship
- Written sometime between 80 and 95 AD

#### Key Verses
- `1 John 1:9`: “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”
- `1 John 3:6`: “No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.”
- `1 John 4:4`: “Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.”
- `1 John 5:13`: “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life.”

### Difficulties
- Ch `2 v27`. "and you have no need that anyone should teach you." [ESV]. The NLT states "But you have received the Holy Spirit, and he lives within you, so you don’t need anyone to teach you what is true."
  - Talks about not needing a teacher because anointed by Christ. How does this apply to pastors in a church preaching on Sunday?
  - Maybe referring to the ability to know right from wrong. John himself is being a teacher.

## Observations

- Knowing Christ, a person will not keep on sinning, making a practice of it. A real believer will seek righteousness ... to be like Christ.
- We all sin, but he will forgive us if we confess. But we can not continue walking in the dark and have fellowship with God.
- We are not to love this world ... sinning, lusting, boasting of what we have accomplished, have, etc. But we are to love our brothers.
- Loving our brothers is shown by actions (i.e., providing physical needs `3:17-18`).
- I can not hate my brother and say that I love God ... this does not work.
- In `summary`:
    - We are changed
    - We do not continue in sinning
    - We love our brothers
    - We are not of this world ... lust, boasting, etc.
