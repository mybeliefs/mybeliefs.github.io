- Written to a wealthy Christian named Philemon
- Written around 62 AD, while Paul was in prison following his voyage to Rome
- During Paul's 3-year ministry in Ephesus (52-55 AD), Philemon became a Christian

### Bible Project
https://bibleproject.com/guides/book-of-philemon/

#### Background
- A leader of the church in Colossae
  - the church meets in his home
- Onesimus had a conflict with Philemon and runs away
- Onesimus visited Paul in prison and became a believer and assistant to Paul

#### 1-7: A Prayer of Thanksgiving
- Thanking God for Philemon's faithfulness to all the saints

#### 8-20: A Request for Forgiveness and Restoration
- Asking Philemon not only to forgive but to take him back as a family member
- This kind of treatment was unheard of
- If Paul and him are partners, then take him back and Paul will repay anything
- The Gospel is about reconciliation. Paul is absorbing the consequences of Onesimus's wrongdoing
- All three of them share the same need for forgiveness

#### 21-25: Conclusion
- Paul is embodying the meaning of the cross, becoming the means for reconciling
- The master-salve relationship is irrelevant, all are brothers in Christ
