## Observations
- Our goal is to be love, not our self-interest
- We are to pray for others in authority
- God wants all to be saved .. came to save sinners!
- The leaders in the Church have requirements
- Be wary of weird doctrines (ch. 4)
- Train yourself to be Godly, just like going to the gym
- Always need to take care of our <ins>immediate family</ins>
- Need to be content with what we have. Pursuing riches leads to trouble. Love of money is the root of all types of evil. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness. <ins>Our hope is in God</ins> who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. 
- Be generous and willing to share
